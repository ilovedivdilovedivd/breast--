</div><p>However, if you think there is any possibility of a hematoma, you should contact your surgeon immediately. It is not uncommon to see a slight degree of size difference early due to asymmetric swelling. (John Whitt, MD (retired))</p><p>The bottom line – if you are worried – arrange to be seen by your Plastic surgeon who WILL know. Personally, from what you describe, I am not too concerned.</p><p>Bleeding after a Breast Augmentation (Hematoma) is seen in the first few days – not a week later and is associated with a large difference between the breasts, with swelling, bruising and a lot of pain on that side. Your symptoms are not classic. But, again, if you are worried, see your surgeon. (Peter A.

</div><p>Hematoma after breast augmentation is usually not subtle. It manifests as a sudden increase in pain and swelling in a breast, accompanied shortly thereafter by bruising and discoloration. What you describe is relatively common initially after breast augmentation; for whatever reason, one side stays slightly more swollen and tender than other. Still, if you have any concerns, don’t hesitate to contact your surgeon. Any exam by him or her should help give you peace of mind. (Sam Jejurikar, MD, Louisville Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>What Are Signs of a Hematoma After Breast Augmentation</h3><p>The signs of a hematoma following breast augmentation are usually increased swelling and pain. You should be checked if you suspect a hematoma because you may need operative intervention. (Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>If you have a hematoma you will most likely know it</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4937" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-fb42a38c06cdbcf9cf17b525cc8a1ffc">

</div><p>If you have a hematoma you will most likely know it. Most likely, any significant hematoma would present with one sided prominent pain, swelling and brusing occuring over a short peirod of time and considerably disproportionate to the opposite normal breast. (Otto Joseph Placik, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Hemotoma</h3><p>The typical signs involve significant swelling of the breast, increased pain or more pain versus the opposite breast, and purple discoloration, These findings can slightly less prominent in women of color especially the purple discoloration. The diagnosis depends on the surgeon’s experience when findings are not obvious. (Earl Stephenson, Jr., MD, DDS, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Hematoma after breast augmentation: Signs</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4939" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The signs of a hematoma after breast augmentation depend on how soon after the surgery it develops. Statistically, if one gets a hematoma, it is more likely to be in one side or the other but less likely in both sides. Therefore, the first clue will often be that one side doesn’t look anything like the other. Mild asymmetry is very common but large asymmetry isn’t. Within the first few days look for an increase in size of one breast over the other associated with increased pain and bruising. If the hematoma occurs several weeks after the surgery, scar tissue may limit the bruising and the only sign might be one-sided swelling and pain. (Barry Stuart Handler, MD, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Hematoma or Swelling After Breast Augmentation</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4938" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The most devistating complication after a breast augmentation is a hematoma. Although very rare it’s unfortunate when it happens. A hematoma will develop almost immediately after surgery resulting in a signigicantly larger breast on one side. The patient is taken back to the OR and the pocket is cleaned out but unfortunately the patient is still left with a large bruise that will spread down the abdominal wall before fading. There can be some asymmetry due to swelling but a hematome results in significant asymmetry immediately. (Christopher L. Hess, MD, New Orleans Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Your description of the breast size difference and pain is not consistant with hematoma . You would had more brusing and also pain with hematoma. Please send pictures. (Kamran Khoobehi, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Sonogram of breast will detect hematoma after breast implants.</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4941" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-5729eadb6841f812a47a108d82e9cd34">

</div><p>You may well have a hematoma, and it should be addressed right away. The signs of hematoma after breast implants are swelling and pain. You need a sonogram. (George J. Beraka, MD (retired), Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Signs of a hematoma after breast augmentation</h3><p>A subtle difference in swelling between the two sides is normal and not indicative of a hematoma that needs to be re-operated upon. A significant hematoma, one that needs surgery, has a dramatic difference between the 2 sides. Differential pain is also normal. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I would speak with your plastic surgeon who may want you to come in for an exam. Signs of a hematoma include asymmetric swelling, pain with arm motion, bruising and asymmetric pain as well.</p><p>It is not uncommon to have a little more discomfort and swelling on one side compared to the other depending on what had to be done at the time of your surgery. (Michael C. Edwards, MD, FACS, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>A hematoma is a collection of blood in the tissue surrounding the breast implant following breast augmentation. Factors that can lead to this type of internal bleeding are trauma to the breast in the immediate postoperative period, situations that can increase your blood pressure immediately after surgery such as vomiting or excessive cough, and certain medications or herbal products that can thin the blood.</p><p>Prior to your surgery, your surgeon will very likely give you a list of medications and supplements that you should avoid prior to your surgery.</p><p>If a <strong>hematoma after breast bugmentation</strong> develops, it is usually accompanied by varying degrees of swelling, discomfort and bruising. The most likely presentation is a breast that increases in size and becomes more painful following the operation.</p><p>The degree of pain and swelling will depend on the amount of internal bleeding that has taken place. If you notice any of these changes after surgery, it is very important to immediately contact your surgeon so that an evaluation can be made. If the diagnosis of a postoperative hematoma is made, then the best treatment is to return to surgery and to remove the accumulated blood.If the accumulated blood is left unattended, it can lead to an unacceptable postoperative result. (John J. Edney, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Signs of a hematoma usually occur within the first 24 hours, enlarging bruised breast, pain unrelenting, and not treated with pain medications. (Peter J. Capizzi, MD, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Signes of hematoma following breast augmentation surgery</h3><p>It is quite common for one breast to hurt more than the other or to be more swollen than the other following breast augmentation. This does not mean you have a hematoma. The signs of a hematoma would be significantly larger breast or bruising on one side. Consult the surgeon who perfumed your procedure if you feel one breast is significantly larger or more bruised than the other. (Christopher J. Morea, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Hematoma following breast augmentation</h3><p>If you have any questions about your health or comfort following breast augmentation surgery, contact your plastic surgeon’s office immediately. They will want to be aware of any problems and / or put your mined at ease. (Michael Law, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Hematoma After Breast Augmentation are certainly a major concern. I tell patients to call immediately if One breast is MUCH more swollen and MUCH more painful. Slight differences are normal. However when in doubt call your surgeon. He should be happy to see you and check (Rady Rahban, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Ice and relax if hematoma after breast augmentation</h3><p>Slight differences in swelling and pain are normal. no need to worry. Signs of a hematoma are bruising, extensive and progressive or worsening swelling on one side, and intense sudden onset pain on one side. If you have any of these call your surgeon immediately. Otherwise, ice and relax. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Anytime there is a change in the breast size, I ask my patient to immediately notify me, such that I can perform an in office examination. I would recommend immediate contact with your plastic surgeon as I am concerned by your swelling combined by pain, which is characteristic of a hematoma. This may require operative intervention to control bleeding, prevent infection, and minimize risk of capsular contracture. I wish you a safe and healthy recovery. (Paul S. Gill, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Signs of a Hematoma After Breast Augmentation</h3><p>It is not uncommon for one breast to be slightly more swollen and hurt a bit more.Typical signs of a hematoma after breast augmentation are pain and increased swelling on one side versus the other side, which progressively becomes more severe over a short period of time.</p><p>Often this is related to a rise in blood pressure and discomfort from retching or vomiting from post-operative nausea, which usually is related to the anesthesia. The breast will become painful, swollen, firm and bruising or discoloration may develop. In many cases, a breast with a hematoma will appear noticably larger than the other breast. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms you should contact your doctor immediately. (Michael D. Cohen, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
