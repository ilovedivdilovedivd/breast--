These infections are much more serious, and can require intravenous antibiotics or even removal of the implant.</p><p>It can sometimes be a challenge determining if a deeper infection has occurred. Your best resource is a board certified plastic surgeon with experience performing breast augmentation. (Kelly Gallego, MD, FACS, Yuba City Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Infections after breast augmentation</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2544" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>It is relatively rare to get an infection after breast augmentation surgery. He can be separated into 2 categories. Deep and superficial.</p><p>Superficial infections usually relate to incisional issues such as stitch abscesses, superficial cellulitis, etc. Deep infections are more serious and usually relate to infection around the implant, inside the pocket. The management of these types of infections is more complex. For superficial infections, local wound care, oral antibiotics will usually treat the majority of these types of infections. If they should recur, then I would recommend culture of the wound and appropriate antibiotic based on wound cultures.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2543" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>Remembered that if a small portion of the incision opens up, that it will take time for that open wound to heal, as opposed to a wound that remains closed. Your surgeon will give you an idea of how long an open wound should take to heal. Deep infections usually involve the entire breast implant pocket and require intravenous antibiotics and in most cases surgical removal of the implant. He would be very sick and have high fevers if this were the case. For any board certified plastic surgeon, these are well known complications that can be managed effectively and quickly. (Kenneth Bermudez, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast, deep sutures, breast augmentation infection</h3><p>It sounds like suture reaaction, body can react to sutures like Vicryl that can cause granulation tissue and discharge. Get it evaluated by a Plastic surgeon. He or she may want to explore the area and remove the deep sutures. (Sanjay Parashar, MD, Dubai Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2545" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>A small part of the suture can start to work itself out, instead of dissolving. As this happens, it may become a superficial suture infection. Usually with antibiotics and wound care, it will heal. The worry is that it may spread to the implant, so do keep an eye on it with your plastic surgeon. (Anne Taylor, MD, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Infection after implants</h3><p>As long as it is just a supeficial wound infection it should clear with local wound care and antibiotics. This is much different than an infected implant which would be a much bigger (but much less common) problem. (Michael Philbin, MD, Edina Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Incision infection after breast augmentation</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2542" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>After any operation, Breast Augmentation included, the body reacts to the suture material that is buried under the skin. That’s how the sutures dissolve. Sometimes that reaction is very close to the surface of the skin, and so it gets red and the stitch may even “spit”.</p><p>Usually, just removing the stitch is enough. If there’s still pus coming out from the area after the stitch was removed, your surgeon may need to carefully open the area up to be sure the process is localized, and not deeper. It should heal up just fine once the source of the inflammation is gone. (Verne Weisberg, MD, Portland Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Possible infection after breast augmentation</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2546" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>It sounds like what you are describing is local irritation of the incision from the small suture poking through. Now that the suture has been removed, the area will more than likely heal uneventfully with proper care, but it may take a little longer than the rest of the incision that isn’t involved. Regular cleansing, antibiotic ointment, and dry guaze all sound like appropriate treatment. I don’t recommend the application of heat to the area, because it isn’t likely to make things better any faster. Close followup with your physician is also essential to monitor for any worsening of the problem. (Amy M. Sprole, MD, Wichita Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Infections take many different turns. 1 – a rip roaring infection can require surgical drainage or the removal of the inplant. Signs of infection after breast augmentation: pain, fever, swelling, redness and perhaps some drainage.</p><p>2 – A local skin infection can have many of the sysmptoms described above but the implant is soft and non-tender. This can usually be treated with antibiotics.</p><p>3 – Finally, most common is something doctors call a spitting suture.</p><p>This is when the dissolvable sutures come through the skin. This presents as a little pus and localized redness. Sinilar to a pimple, the suture pops out and theredness resolves. (Robert M. Freund, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>My suggestion would be to speak with your plastic surgeon. While what you are describing does sound like a superficial infection, you would be best evaluated in person by a trained plastic surgeon. Generally, infection rates after breast augmentation alone is around 2%.</p><p>Many are superficial that can be treated with oral antibiotics and/or local wound care. Your description seems to be consistent with a stitch abscess which can develop from bacteria accumulating around a dissolving suture. Patience is usually all that is needed in dealing with a stitch abscess.</p><p>However, if there is a deeper infection present, there is risk to the underlying implant. If an implant becomes infected, intravenous antibiotics are the initial treatment. If the infection still does not resolve, then only removal of the implant cures the infection. Prevention is the best treatment for infection of breast implants. In our practice in Plano, many steps are taken in the operating room to prevent infection.</p><p>Using a no-touch technique, changing instruments, washing the implant, and covering all exposed areas when inserting the implant all help decrease infection rates. (Naveen Setty, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Sometimes a stitch place on the inside will come out through the skin. This spitting stitch will often be seen in the office and taken out. The skin in this area may be open. Usually with local wound care, some antibiotics, and time, the wound will close itself up. Please don’t take sutures out yourself. Please make sure that your plastic surgeon knows what is going on so that he can determine if it is a; spitting stitch, superficial infection, or deep infection. (Jeffrey Roth, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Infection after breast augmentation surgery</h3><p><strong>Signs of infection after breast augmentation</strong> may occur after breast augmentation surgery, and should be evaluated and managed by your plastic surgeon.</p><p>Superficial infections may be treated with local wound care and antibiotics, but deeper infections involving the implants themselves may require more aggressive treatment and surgical intervention. (Olivia Hutchinson, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It sounds like a superficial infection cause by suture. This not uncommon and it usually resolves with local wound care,oral antibiotics, local exploration of the wound and removal of the suture.</p><p>However, is very important that you follow with your plastic surgeon because sometimes this superficial infections can be complicated by deep infections involving the breast implant. (Jaime Perez, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Infection after breast augmentation is very rare, but can happen. If you have a signs of infection after breast augmentation, you may need long term antibiotics and sometimes even need to have the implant removed.</p><p>You should follow up closely with your surgeon. It is very important that you see a board certified plastic surgeon. (David Shafer, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The suture you mentioned is probably and absorbable stitch. Even though we say it is absorbable, this can take several weeks. It is not uncommon for the stitch to work its way to the skin surface. Usually once it falls out or is removed as in your case, everything will heal uneventfully. It can be disconcerting while this occurs. Keeping the area clean with soap and water, antibiotic ointment, and a sterile bandaid or guaze is all that is needed. The bleeding is temporary and of little concern. If it persists for several days however you should see your surgeon. Heat or cold application do not hasten the healing. (Randy Proffitt, MD, Mobile Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There are two main type of infections possible after a breast augmentation:</p><p>Superficial infections: It does not involve the implant and usually is related to the sutures. These type of infections usually go away on their own or with a short course of antibiotics.</p><p>Deep infections: These involve the implant and are more serious in terms of the possible final result. Oral antibiotics should be started.</p><p>Cultures should be taken if there is drainage to make sure the antibiotic is appropriate for the infection.</p><p>If the oral antibiotics do not work IV antibiotics should be started or the pocket should be explored.</p><p>When this is done the implant should be exchanged and a drain shoud be placed. (Remus Repta, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Plastic surgeons often place sutures underneath the skin and then rely on the body’s healing to dissolve those sutures over time – sometimes the body doesn’t dissolve the stitch, but instead works it out to the incision. It sounds like this is what happened to you. Sometimes this will happen more than once, as there was more than one stitch placed. It is important to see your surgeon when there are any changes in your incision (i.e. a new “bad spot”) to avoid a deeper infection that may result in loss of your implants. Stay in close contact with your surgeon and his or her nurses to avoid a serious complication. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Infection & Complication Following Breast Augmentation</h3><p><strong>Infection after breast augmentation</strong>  is a serious complication that can result in patients losing their breast implants. Signs of infection include; redness, swelling, drainage, pain, fever and flu like symptoms. When any of these symptoms occur, they should be investigated aggressively.</p><p>This may include laboratory studies, ultrasonography, and possibly fluid aspiration from the breast pocket for culture. Based on your history, it appears that you have a superficial type of infection known as a stitch abscess. This results from an absorbable suture protruding through the skin and becoming secondarily infected.</p><p>Treatment involves removing the suture and treating the wound with dressing changes and antibiotics. If improvement doesn’t occur rapidly, then further investigation is indicated to rule out infection of the breast pocket. It’s important that your plastic surgeon closely monitors your progress. It appears that your wound is slowly improving and should continue to get better with time. (Richard J. Bruneteau, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Infection with Breast Augmentation</h3><p>Although infections following Breast Augmentation are rare, it can happen. If the breast implant gets infected, your surgeon may need to remove it, treat the infection, and replace the implant at a later date. Please see your surgeon for a culture, and antibotics as soon as possible. (Robert E. Zaworski, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Infection after Breast Augmentation</h3><p>Sounds like what you are describing is a suture that is “spitting”. A deeper infection is more serious and could threaten your implant and cause them to be removed.</p><p>Make sure your plastic surgeon exams you to determine the care you will need. Stay in close touch but don’t freak out out or do anything like placing heat. Best thing is to keep it clean. (Raj S. Ambay, MD, Brandon Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Incision not healing after breast augmentation</h3><p>Sounds like a very localized reaction to the suture. I have seen this happen in some patients that are sensitive to certain absorbable sutures including barbed sutures. If it has taken this long to resolve, I would recommend excising the the area and closing again in a different fashion. (John Michael Thomassen, MD, Fort Lauderdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I agree with the other surgeons, call your doctor immediately, he needs to see you to prevent what could become a much larger problem. Superficial infections can be treated with Abx but deeper infections or infections of the implants often require removal of the implant with replacement later. But once again, I stress , see your doctor immediately. (Jonathan Weiler, MD, Baton Rouge Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Possible infection after breast augmentation</h3><p>It is very important that you return to your surgeon as soon as possible so that they can evaluate this. A superficial infection can be treated without much trouble, but if allowed to progress, and if it involves the underlying implant, you may have to have the implant removed to successfully deal with the infection.
