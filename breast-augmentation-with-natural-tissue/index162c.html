</div><p>We also have many more options of implant shapes and sizes, more than ever before. A smaller, perhaps shaped, implant should work well for her without making her look ridiculous or completely unproportioned. (Ellen A. Janetzke, MD, Birmingham Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In most cases like this, going under the muscle will help provide more coverage. Results can be quite good with this.

</div><p>Ample breast tissue is not necessary for a breast to look natural after a breast augmentation. Even, men with zero breast tissue sometimes get implants and can look natural. Suggestions to achieve a natural appearance are:</p><ol>
<li>Choose aconservative size. It is much easier to create a natural looking breast when the patient has significant breast tissue. A larger implant will look like a mound on the chest, however, with minimal tissue.</li>
<li>Use a silicone implant, which is less likely to show wrinkles, and it will feel more natural,</li>
<li>Place the implant under the pectoralis muscle so that she has more tissue covering the implants.</li>
<li>Consult a plastic surgeon certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery. (E. Ronald Finger, MD, Savannah Plastic Surgeon)</li>

</div><p>In patients that desire natural breast tissue appearance for breast augmentation one can consider fat augmentation which can certainly be done safely if fat injections are done correctly above and around the breast tissue. One must know that this will give you one breast size augmentation only.</p><p>For patients with little or no breast tissue, a breast implant is still a better option and one can consider doing fat augmentation around the breast implant as well for improved shaping and correction of asymmetry. (Rod J. Rohrich, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Natural breast looking augmentation for A-cup patients</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3782" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a86fe13a97262f852bdd92c8b935f613">

</div><p>When there is essentially no breast tissue to begin with and the chest/breast skin and soft-tissue is very tight the size/volume of the implant that will be needed to create a natural looking breast is smaller than usual.</p><p>I would recommend choosing silicone implants – either gummy bear type implants or form stable implants. These should be placed under the muscle and should be moderate in size if a natural result is desired, knowing that if additional volume is desired an implant exchange down the road may be needed.</p><p>Going from an A to a C or larger is possible in one stage but this will result in relatively unnatural looking breast for several months following surgery while the skin and soft tissue relaxes. (Remus Repta, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Small breasts with little soft tissue a challenge</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3784" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Although a small lady with little natural breast tissue and tight skin and muscles over the chest area are a challenge to the plastic surgeon performing breast augmentation, it can be done safely and with good results. I would recommend that the implants, either saline or silicone be placed in submuscular pockets to give more padding between the implant and the skin.</p><p>Also, I would recommend that you do not try to go too large. It sounds like small implants in the 210-240 cc range might work better. Also, I would prefer saline implants to silicone implants because saline implants are inserted deflated and then inflated once in the pocket. But overall, it should not deter your fiance from breast implants if she desires them. Breast implants may help with her self image and self confidence. (James Tang, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I know this is a crude example but it helps to make the point. If you hide a golf ball (implant) under a silk sheet (tissue), the appearance will be very ball-like.</p><p>However, if you hide the baseball under a thick comforter, the thickness of the comforter will greatly influence the result. A very thick comforter may make the ball barely visible.</p><p>The comforter will determine the overall appearance of the result. If you change the golf ball to a volley ball, it may appear more round.</p><p>In individuals with very little tissue ( thin athletic women with low body fat and an A cup breast), the breast implants may be more noticeable and will ultimately have a significant role in determining the appearance of the outcome.</p><p>In individuals with C or D cup breasts, the overall breast tissue and position of the gland will have a greater effect on the overall appearance of the final result (Otto Joseph Placik, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast augmentation in thin patients</h3><p>Breast augmentation in very thin patients with small breasts can give excellent results. These patients often have the most dramatic improvement in self-esteem because they have always been very self-conscious about their breast size. As long as an appropriate sized implant is chosen, the breast should look “normal”. Also, placement of the implant below the muscle will help mask the implant in someone with thin skin. Having a detailed discussion with a board-certified plastic surgeon will help in making a decision in proceeding with surgery. (Naveen Setty, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>A most natural looking breast implants result is very possible in a thin woman</h3><p>To achieve a very natural result in your fiance, it is important for the surgeon to pick a range of implants that will fit well for her specific her body type. I consider two factors when selecting implants for my patients:</p><ol>
<li>Dimensional planning</li>
<li>Gel Implant Sizing system</li>
</ol><p>Dimensional planning – The measurements of her chest wall are taken. Also, the breast dimensions including the height, width, and current dimensions of each breast form the basis of dimensional planning.</p><p>Based on these measurements, the implant size is recommended. This will give her a unique breast implant that is suited for her body frame. Even her fitness levels and other relevant criteria are taken into consideration.</p><p>Gel Implant Sizing system – During the preliminary breast implant consultation, she will be provided with an option to “try on” a variety of implant shapes and sizes. She can also visualize the possible outcomes of her surgery which helps her to get that perfect size to give her the shape that she has longed for. This way her preferences are known and she can then pick a range of implants that will “fit” just right to give a most natural looking breast implants fuller look. (C. Bob Basu, MD, FACS, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>My fiance is Asian and has little or no breast tissue. She wears a bra that is essentially all foam, as there is no need to wear one. She is very self-conscious about it and wants to have <strong>most natural looking breast implants</strong>. I am concerned that with so little natural tissue that it would not look right, and she might be even more self-conscious. Would breast implants look most natural on a woman with little or no natural tissue, and if so, how much enhancement could she expect?</p><p>She is very thin with very tight skin” Excellent question. The width of the breast, the width of the available soft tissue coverage, the distensibility of the breast skin, the width of the flat part of the anterior chest, among others are the MOST important factors in guiding the choice of an ideal breast tissue. Breast tissue coverage IS important and the attractiveness of an augmentation in a woman WITH adequate soft tissue coverage over the breast implants ALWAYS SURPASSES that of an identical woman without sufficient coverage. That being said, attractive augmentations can be obtained in some women with little soft tissue coverage as you describe. My recommendation would be a round,smooth, high profile Mentor gel implants (which will ripple less), placed under the muscle which will match the distensibility of the breast skin. another totally different, yet natural alternative is the use of the Brava breast distention system followed by 2-3 staged fat transfers to the breast. in the long term THIS would produce the best looking and cheapest result. (Peter A. Aldea, MD, Memphis Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast enlargement in thin women with thin tissue can look natural</h3><p>Thin women with minimal breast tissue and tight skin can achieve a natural, pleasing natural looking breast enlargement by following a few simple guidelines.</p><p>After careful measurements, choose an implant whose width closely matches the patients breast width.</p><p>This will look the most proportional and likely will not be oversized for the patient either.</p><p>Choosing a smaller implant won’t put too much tension on the tight skin. The skin will accomadate to the new volume and relax over a few months.</p><p>Request the implant be placed under the chest muscle as this gives the most cover of the implant and will best camoflouge potential rippling frequently seen in thin skinned patients.</p><p>And finally, as long as she is over 22 years old, strongly consider silicone implants after a full consultation with your plastic surgeon as the feel is more natural and rippling is less than with saline. (Jeffrey M. Darrow, MD, Boston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Implants for Small Breasted Slight Women Works Well</h3><p>For small breasted women with minimal body fat and small frames, such as in many Asian females, a high profile silicone gel implant provides excellent results. Measurements of the chest wall with consideration of the patient’s height and weight are key, and in those patients that have small chest walls, a high profile breast implant combines a narrow base (diameter of the implant) with the ability to provide cleavage without looking too “busty”.</p><p>The silicone gel implant has less chance of rippling as is occasionally seen in those patients that start out with little to no breast tissue and minimal subcutaneous fat and undergo saline breast enlargement. I believe that such an operation would greatly increase your girlfriend’s self esteem and provide considerable “spring in her step”.(Daniel Shapiro, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast enlargement helps women with self esteem.</h3><p>Natural looking breast enlargement helps women with self esteem. This has been shown in many different studies. I think that breast enlargement has very little to do with HOW the patient looks and everything to do with how the patient FEELS about how they look.</p><p>She has already developed an image in her mind about how she would like to look. The hard part is matching her expectation to what she actually gets. I have found a very successful way to allow patients to choose their own implant size and fulfill their expectations very consistently.</p><p>I perform an exam and measure the breasts and chest and then determine a range of implants that can be used to naturally improve her shape and then I let my patients try on those implants inside a bra until they see in the mirror what they have already envisioned in their mind.</p><p>This works even for very tight skin, small native breast patients. (Richard H. Fryer, MD, Salt Lake City Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Natural breast enlargement results</h3><p>Absolutely your girlfiend would be a great candidate for <strong>natural looking breast enlargement</strong>, given the information we have. Small, thin women with tight skin can do very well with breast implants.</p><p>The key is to do careful measurements, choose a silicone gel implant, go under the muscle, and choose a small implant that “fits” her.
