</div><p>The elasticity of the skin is also an important factor. If you decide finally to have the surgery before children avoid big implants. (Nodas Kapositas, MD, Greece Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast feeding after Breast Augmentation</h3><p>It is very safe to proceed with Breast Augmentation prior to having children. And yes, you will be able to breast feed if you have implants. The breasts may undergo many changes after pregnancy and breast feeding. However, you will always have the implant volume helping with any changes that may occur. (Christopher J. Morea, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast augmentation before or after children?</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2164" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>This is a difficult question to answer because its a personal choice. We never know what will transpire in life, but I can give some helpful hints.Almost all breast augmentation patients will have additional cosmetic breast procedures sometime in their lives as most implants will eventually need exchanging.</p><p>The timing of these procedures is up to the individual.After an augmentation and then pregnancy, the primary risks are being uncomfortably large during pregnancy and breast feeding and further enlargement of the breast skin during pregnancy/breast feeding leading to excessive skin stretch.</p><p>Being too large can be relieved by simply removing the implant. This is easily performed under local anesthesia even during pregnancy. Smooth implants are easier to remove than textured implants. Later the implants can be replaced after the skin has retracted back.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2161" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The skin after pregnancy will retract back to a variable degree depending on its natural elasticity. In general, small and medium size breast skin will tend to retract back closer to their original shape and not require any additional breast lifting, but some volume loss may have occurred and the patient may desire additional implant volume.</p><p>Larger breasts or those with poor elasticity may require breast lifting with or without further augmentation. To what degree the additional augmentation volume affects the breast tissue skin is unknown. Those with larger or poor elasticity prior to pregnancy probably will require a lift after pregnancy anyway. So, breast lift scarring will probably eventually be required whether a patient has the augmentation before pregnancy or after.As one can ascertain, there is no right answer.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2165" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>If the time is right for you, then proceed. If you have concerns, then it is reasonable to wait. (Scott Haupt, MD, Salt Lake City Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Pregnancy and Breast Augmentation timing</h3><p>This question is a common one but when it comes down to it you will have to decide. My general recommendations are that if you are planning on children in the next 1-3 years wait. If you do go ahead with a breast augmentation then I would recommend not using a periareolar incision as it may prevent you from successfully breast feeding whereas the other approaches are not related. (Larry S. Nichter, MD, MS, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Depending on the Prosedure</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2163" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Most Breast Augmentation Procedures do not affect your ability to breastfeed. With Trans-umbilical Breast Augmentation the implant is inserted from the belly button under the Belly and does not affect your ability to breastfeed. Its safe if done by the right surgeon. (Jonathan Fisher, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast implants before of after kids</h3><p>Pregnancy will always make your breasts sag and less attractive. That being said, if kids are not on the immediate horizon I do not think that it is a bad idea to have an augmentation in the meantime. (Christopher J. Davidson, MD, FACS, Boston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Most women have some degree of breast feeding problems – this means even women who have not had a breast augmentation. If you really want a BBA now, you can make certain choices to help decrease the chance of interfering with your ability to breast feed.</p><p>These include going under the muscle, and not using a periareolar incision. If you wait until after having children, you may also need a lift. It also depends on when you plan on having children. You may want to wait if you’re going to have children in the next 1-2 years.</p><p>It’s a personal choice in which you have to weigh the risks and benefits. You should discuss this with a board certified plastic surgeon in your area. (Asif Pirani, MD, FRCS(C), Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Augmentation Before of After Pregnancy?</h3><p>Whether to have a breast augmentation before pregnancy is a very common concern. Breast augmentation can affect one’s ability to breast feed, but probably not. Pregnancy can negatively affect the appearance of the breasts, but it can do that whether you have implants or not.</p><p>I feel that if you plan on being pregnant soon, then it would be best to wait. However, if you plan on having children in the future but aren’t sure when. Then I would say to enjoy the results and confidence of breast augmentation until then. It’s a personal decision, so have an honest discussion with your board certified plastic surgeon, and together you can make the decision that’s best for you. (Dustin L. Reid, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Should you wait to have breast augmentation until after having children</h3><p>The decision to have Breast Augmentation surgery is a very personal one. I have seen women who have found it important to them to have the surgery in their twenties before they have found a life partner, in their thirties and forties after they have finished their families and some in their fifties or sixties as it is something they have always wanted to do. If having children is something you have planned in the near future then it would be best to wait until after your family.</p><p>Your breasts will go through many changes with a pregnancy, this will occur with or without implants in place. Having implants will not change your ability to become pregnant or carry a baby successfully. It is unlikely that having implants will affect the ability to breast feed. Many of my patients have become pregnant and have successfully breast fed following their breast augmentation surgery. (David K. Ward, MD, Surrey Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Augmentation Before or After Pregnancy and Children</h3><p>This is a personal choice, and there is no correct answer. Having breast implants inserted before having children does not cause any change in the likelihood of being able to breast feed. Also, implants do not pose any safety risk for breast feeding. However, with pregnancy there can be enlargement and stretching of the breasts which may necessitate some cosmetic correction following pregnancies. This could be a breast lift, or perhaps increasing the size of the implants to fill out the new stretched skin.</p><p>Alternatively, waiting until after pregnancies is reasonable. However, at that point you may require both breast implant as well as a breast lift to handle the excess stretched skin. Also, it is often the case that after having children mothers do not have the time or resources to undergo surgery, and often wait until their children are 10 years old or more. So, the early decision to avoid breast implants as a young adult often means waiting 15 years or more until having any cosmetic breast enhancement. I have heard some women refer to this as a “missed youth”. (Cory Goldberg, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast augmentation should not inhibit breastfeeding</h3><p>Not every woman is able to breastfeed, whether she has implants or not. Breast augmentation should not impede your ability to breastfeed. If a woman develops an infection of the nipple while nursing, there is a slight risk the infection could extend from the nipple ducts through the breast tissue to the implant. There is less risk if the implant is placed deep to the muscle rather than the breast tissue. (Wandra K. Miles, MD, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Feeding and implants</h3><p>If you were able to breast feed before you should be able to after. It is really up to the patient if they decide to wait or not.</p><p>It depends how much your breast bother you now and how long you want to wait.</p><p>Usually implants help the breast from sagging after having a baby as well. (Norman M. Rowe, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Augmentation Before Children</h3><p>I see women around your age have breast augmentation all the time and go on to have children and breast feed without issues.</p><p>It is important to use an inframammory incision (under the breast in the fold) as opposed to a periarolar incision (around the areola).</p><p>All women have bacteria in their milk ducts and using a periarolar incision will expose the implants to the bacteria. Exposing the implant to bacteria can cause encapsulation (hardening of the breast tissue) which can cause a number of visual changes as well has physical changes in the appearence of the breast. Using an inframammory incision allows you to avoid the milk ducts all together. (Milind K. Ambe, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Many women undergo breast augmentation prior to having children.</h3><p>There is no right or wrong answer as to whether you should wait to have children prior to undergoing a breast augmentation. This is a very personal decision. I have seen numerous patients who have undergone breast augmentation via different approaches and were successful at nursing.</p><p>Having said this, it is difficult for any plastic surgeon to guaranatee that a woman will be able to nurse following breast augmentation. (Sanjay Grover, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Augmentation Before Pregnancy</h3><p>The first consideration is the possibility that breast augmentation may interfere with your ability to breast feed. Whenever I have had occasion to see in my practice a breast augmentation patient who has had a pregnancy after her augmentation, I have made it a point to ask if she tried to breast feed, and if so, was she successful?</p><p>The patients who did not breast feed successfully have consistently been the ones who had reduced nipple sensation after their augmentations. The risk of nipple numbness after breast augmentation is typically quoted to be between 1% and 15%. The risk is higher with above-muscle implant placement and with large implants(&gt;425cc).</p><p>The main nerve to the nipple comes out from between the ribs at the outer edge of the pectoral muscle and enters the breast tissue, the winds its way to the nipple. If we are making a subpectoral implant pocket, we can see and feel the nerve at the outer edge of the pectoral muscle and avoid injuring it. If we are making a subglandular pocket in front of the pectoral muscle, the nerve to the nipple looks like one of the many connective tissue fibers that attach the back wall of the breast to the pectoral muscle.</p><p>It is at risk to be divided as the subglandular pocket is enlarged to let the implant rest comfortably centered behind the nipple. The risk is increased for the larger pockets required by larger implants. To maximize your chances of breast feeding successfully, choose below-muscle implant placement and a moderate-sized implant.</p><p>The second consideration is the risk that pregnancy and breast feeding will cause your augmented breast to droop after you complete the pregnancy and finish breast feeding. This risk can be minimized by keeping your pregnancy weight gain to no more than your OB recommends, and wearing supportive bras during your pregnancy and breast feeding time.</p><p>I have repeatedly observed patients in your circumstance go ahead with the augmentation, and within a year a relationship blossoms that leads to a pregnancy. If this scenario resonates with you as I mention it, now may very well be the right time for you. (John J. Seaberg, MD, FACS, Columbia Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Timing of Breast Augmentation with possible pregnancy</h3><p>The majority of my breast augmentation patients are in the child bearing years. We support breast augmentation during this period. Many women are unable to breast feed, and although breast augmentation can rarely affect milk production, it is hard to tell if the surgery is the source of the lack of milk production. I would visit with a board certified plastic surgeon to share your goals. Unless you are planning on pregnancy within a year, I would feel comfortable offering you the procedure. (Paul S. Gill, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
