More often, you may notice some numbness right after surgery that gradually fades over time as the nerves heal.</p><p>The pressure caused by larger implants may contribute to this possibility, as can the type of incision placement used during surgery. With the type of modest size increase you’re describing of about a cup size to simply improve symmetry, surgery carries a very low chance of affecting sensation in your breasts. It’s important to discuss all the risks and benefits with your plastic surgeon before making a final decision. (Nirav Savalia, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Sensation versus symmetry</h3><p>It’s hard to say without seeing pictures and really without being able to do a full history and exam in person, but, I would caution you that sensory changes are possible though not guaranteed.</p><p>If you don’t want to jeopardize sensation, then surgery is probably not for you. However, if the asymmetry bothers you enough, then the risks of surgery (usually small) become worth it. (Matthew H. Conrad, MD, Wichita Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Loss of sensation after breast augmentation?</h3><p>Immediately after breast augmentation, most patients notice some temporary changes in sensation which are part of the normal process of having surgery and healing. Complete loss of sensation is uncommon and not an expected outcome, however, the risk does exist. In general, the larger the change in breast size (the larger the implant), the more likely you are to have changes in sensation. Bryan Correa, MD, The Woodlands Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Any surgery on the breast can potentially alter sensation to the nipple, depending upon incision location. There is always (generally) a temporary change in sensation from the stretching of the nerves which can lead to decreased or increased level of sensitivity.</p><p>Permanent numbness to the nipple due to division of the nerve to the nipple (4th intercostal) is much less likely but highest in the periareolar approach (especially with a lift), followed by the inframammary and least likely with the transaxillary approach. Generally, the larger the incision the more likely numbness will be, hence silicone implant insertion has a higher risk than an equivalent sized saline implant procedure. Your plastic surgeon should have this full discussion with you prior to your procedure. (Scott A. Brenman, MD, FACS, Philadelphia Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Loss of Sensation After Breast Augmentation</h3><p>In my experience the loss of sensation to the nipple in particular is uncommon. Some women may have small areas of numbs near an incision, any incision for any procedure. The nerve to the nipple comes around the outer part of the breast and is most likely to be injured when trying to place an implant that is relatively large given the patient’s size. Using a conservative size implant will have less risk than a larger implant. Since the overall risk is low my recommendation would be to have the surgery if it is something you really desire. The overall risk for this problem is low. (Ralph R. Garramone, MD, Fort Myers Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Sensation after breast augmentation</h3><p>It is rare to have permanent breast numbness after augmentation. It has been quoted at ten percent, but I have not seen anywhere near that in my practice. Numbness around the skin at the bottom of the breast is common for a few weeks or even a couple of months, but then it returns.</p><p>Numbness at the areola and nipple is even less common. (Gregory Diehl, MD, FACS, Long Island Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There are a wide variety of symptoms that patients experience after breast augmentation and yours sound like they are within the normal range for 3 weeks post operatively. Check with your surgeon to be sure though! (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It is not uncommon to have some hypersensitivity of the nipple and areola areas following Breast Augmentation.</p><p>This may last for several weeks, until you “accommodate” to the increased sensation that may be a result of stretching of the nerves or exposure of more nerve endings due to your breasts being larger.</p><p>The good news is that you did not lose any sensitivity of the nipples, but too much of a good thing may not be a blessing in this case.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2258" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-9956625788111d2823a5ab1bc05f79fa">

</div><p>I recommend a low dose of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (Motrin, Advil, Ibuprofen, etc.), which seems to lessen the hypersensitivity.</p><p>If there is any fever, drainage, increased swelling of the breast, or worsening pain, you should see your doctor immediately. Otherwise, this problem should be self-limited. (Athleo Louis Cambre, MD, )</p><h3>Swelling and redness after breast augmentation could be signs of infection</h3><p>Breast augmentation swelling and redness at times is a sign of infection, and at other times is normal increase in blood flow to the area that is healing. You need to see your plastic surgeon and be evaluated. (S. Sean Younai, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>After a breast augmentation.</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2257" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>It is normal for your nipples & areolas to feel pain, soreness and sensitivity after a breast augmentation surgery. Your nerves need some time to conjoin back together and this make take weeks, even months to go away. Until then, a massage can sometimes help, especially with the throbbing pain. (Mel T. Ortega, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Pain after breast augmentation</h3><p>Hypersensitivity is to be expected after breast augmentation. It is due to the nerves being stretched and inflamed. NSAID’s are the best for these symptoms(motrin, celebrex,etc) (Gregory Sexton, MD, Columbia Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Hypersensitivity is normal.</h3><p>You can gently massage the painful areas and the sensation should improve with more massage.

</div><p>Nipple/areola hypersensitivity is a common occurence after breast augmentation surgery. The fact that both nipples are involved makes it highly unlikely that an infection is present. Talk it over with your surgeon. (Kenneth R. Francis, MD, FACS, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Burning sensation and swelling post augmentation not uncommon</h3><p>Burning sensations and swelling a few weeks after breast augmentation are common. However, if there is redness or severe swelling and severe pain, you should follow-up with your doctor. (Steven Wallach, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Loss of sensation is always a possibility when you operate on the breasts. However, it is unlikely if the surgeon has experience with breast augmentation.</p><p>With transaxilllary endoscopic breast augmentation (armpit approach), the space is visualized in its entirety, and can actually lower the risk of injuring the nerves that supply sensation to the nipple. (Gary Lawton, MD, FACS, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Changes in sensation after breast enlargement is common, but usually temporary. Permanent changes in sensation or complete loss after primary augmentation is very rare.</p><p>The nerve that gives you special sensation to the nipple starts in your spine. The nerve travels around your ribs and into the breast from underneath.</p><p>If the nerve is stretched (by a large implant) that may manifest as sensation in the nipple. Fortunately total loss of sensation is rare. Most patients have normal sensation to their breasts by six months after the surgery. (Stephan Finical, MD, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Loss of sensation following augmentation</h3><p>While possible, it is very uncommon to have permanent loss of sensation in the nipple or breast skin following augmentation. Changes in <strong>sensation after breast augmentation</strong> in the early postoperative period are quite common however. If a lift is performed in conjunction with the procedure, the risk of changes in sensation will increase slightly. (Earl E. Ferguson III, MD, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Sensation after breast implants</h3><p>Nipple sensation after placing breast implants can be temporary or permanent. the permanent loss of sensation is rare and most patients experience some minor and temporary decrease in sensation. (Frank J. Ferraro, MD, Paramus Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nipple sensation following breast augmentation</h3><p>Larger implants stretch the nerves of the breast more and require a larger pocket. Both may result in an increased risk of losing nipple sensation. Choose a more moderate size implant to decrease your risk. (David Stoker, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nipple sensation after breast Augmentation</h3><p>While loss of sensation is a risk associated with breast augmentation, most patients undergo this procedure with no loss of sensation. About 95% of patients notice little or no change in sensation, but it is important to understand all of this risks that are associated with surgery. (Michael E. Ciaravino, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Loss of sensation with Breast Augmentation</h3><p>So there is a lot of misunderstanding about loss of nipple sensation with breast augmentation. The bottom line is that is has NOTHING to do with the incision. Doesnt matter if its via the areola or even if you have a lift.</p><p>The majority of the sensation to a nipple comes from a nerve called the 4th Intercostal Nerve and it is located on the edge of the muscle near the armpit. What causes the loss of sensation is damage to this nerve. Why this happens is aggressive dissection by your doctor and selecting too big an implant! Make sure to measure your chest diameter and select a size that is appropriate NOT what you want! (Rady Rahban, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nipple sensation after breast augmentation</h3><p>Following breast augmentation, a certain amount of change in sensation in the breast and nipple can be experience but is usually temporary.</p><p>This may manifest as either decreased sensation or increased sensitivity around the breast and nipple areolar complex. During the operation (especially if the implant was placed through an incision around the nipples) the small sensory nerves can get stretched or bruised. While the nerves recover, patients can experience some tingling or a burning sensation. This is usually short lived and resolves with time. A small proportion of women may have some long term change in the sensation of the nipples, but this is quite rare.Placing the implant through an incision in the breast crease, into a pocket underneath the chest muscle helps to reduce the chances of developing change in sensation to the nipples. (Kunaal Jindal, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Breast augmentation may initially cause swelling and loss of nipple sensitivity that should improve over the course of several weeks to a few months.</p><p>The swelling of your breasts will last for approximately four to six weeks before it begins to subside.</p><p>The loss of sensitivity in the nipples should begin to return to normal after two to three weeks if the nerves were not stretched excessively during the surgery.</p><p>Excessive stretching of the nerves may cause a loss of nipple sensitivity that may start to improve after three months.</p><p>If the procedure causes nipple numbness, which does not always occur, it can take six to twelve months for normal feeling in the nipples to return.</p><p>Overall, after the recovery period of a successful procedure, you should begin to regain normal sensitivity in the breasts. (Norman G. Morrison, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nipple sensitivity after breast augmentation</h3><p>The incidence of loss of nipple sensitivity after a breast augmentation, no matter which incision is used, is low, less than 1%. Although it seems counterintuitive, the periareolar incision sensitivity alteration is the same as the other approaches as the nerve that gives the nipple sensitivity course from the fourth rib and goes through the breast tissue and not the skin. There can be some temporary numbness of the nipple after surgery from stretching of the nerves but the loss of sensitivity on a permanent basis is quite low. (Julio Garcia, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>With any breast procedure, there is a chance of loosing some sensitivity somewhere on the breast. However, the risk is low. If you do loose some sensitivity, it still might return over the next year. The incision under the breast has the lowest chance of interfering with nipple sensitivity. Some women may even become more sensitive after surgery. (Connie Hiers, MD, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Loss of sensitivity after breast augmentation</h3><p>While it is possible to lose sensitivity of your breasts after breast augmentation, it is quite uncommon. The loss of sensitivity can be of two types:</p><ul>
<li>loss of nipple sensitivity</li>
<li>loss of sensitivity of the skin of the breast</li>
</ul><p>Either type of loss is usually transient, and can often resolve over a variable amount of time. In a small percentage of women, this can be permanent. There are certain factors that can increase the frequency of sensitivity loss. These are use of an incision around the areola (periareolar approach) and use of a large implant. So in short, it is not inevitable to lose sensitivity and is fortunately unlikely. (Jeffrey Rockmore, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It is not likely you will lose sensitivity completely after getting a breast augmentation. At first, yes, you will have nerve damage from the incision but that will only be in the beginning. As the nerves slowly recover, you will start feeling sensitivity and sometimes it might become more sensitive than before. However, it does take time for the nerves to unite back together after a breast augmentation. (Mel T. Ortega, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Loss of sensitivity after Breast Augmentation</h3><p>There can be loss of nipple sensitivity after breast augmentation but with good surgical technique, this is uncommon. Placement of the implants through a crease incision and using meticulous surgical technique should avoid injury to the nerves that give sensitivity to the nipples. Ask your surgeon specifically about his/her incidence of nipple sensory loss after breast augmentation. (Matthew Schulman, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
