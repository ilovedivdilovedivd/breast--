This should take about 6 to 8 weeks where you can go bra shopping and know your true new breast size and cup size.</p><p>Some techniques that offer less bruising and swelling may reveal your breast size a bit sooner.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_271" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d87d550619663a1157fa2e6f7e0b1eb5">

</div><p>For example, there are quick recovery techniques that can have a less than 24 hour recovery with minimal swelling and bruising. See the video for more info on this less traumatic technique. (Ashkan Ghavami, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Don’t buy new bra for two months</h3><p>After breast augmentation abdominal swelling starts to improve after the first week and continues to do so for the first 8-12 weeks. So does the implant position that initially might look quite high.</p><p>Be patient, and considering your dimensions you should be a full C or small D cup at the end. Congratulations on your breast augmentation! (Humberto Palladino, MD, FACS, El Paso Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Abdominal swelling and bruising with breast augmenation</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_275" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-0bd9af67fa10f450931b6e2bee317cc2">

</div><p>You should expect swelling at 5 days post procedure. The implants need to assume their final position and the swelling will also make the breasts a little larger in the beginning. Wait until the abdominal swelling dissipates before buying bras. This could take up to 2 months before you have your final result. (Jeffrey W. Hall, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>80% of Swelling & Bruising from Breast Augmentation is gone within the First Three Weeks</h3><p>After a standard breast augmentation, I would expect that 80% of the swelling should be gone in the first three weeks. The last 20% may need another week or two for it to fully resolve. Everybody is different however, and some people maintain swelling longer than others. (John J. Edney, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Abdominal swelling post-breast augmentation</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_273" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>After breast augmentation, it is common to have some abdominal swelling after the surgical procedure, especially if placed in the submuscualr position. Swelling will significantly subside within a couple of weeks, and will likely completely resolve by 2-3 months postoperative.</p><p>5 days postop is early and is typical to have a fair amount of swelling at this time. Also, cup size is always variable, as not all bras are made standard and one brand may give a different cup size from another. Ice packs, compression bras, and anti-inflammatories are things that I advise to my patients. (Lewis Albert Andres, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Swelling at this point is very normal and will take some time to resolve</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_274" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Swelling & bruising after surgery is very normal and lasts for different periods of time in different people. That said, at only 5 days out, EVERYBODY is still swollen. I usually tell my patients to expect swelling & bruising for 3 months. In the first week after surgery, the muscle in particular is most swollen and this gives the appearance of excess fullness in the upper breast.</p><p>This can be concerning for patients but is completely normal. The upper pole swelling slowly improves over the few weeks following surgery, but the general shape and feel of the breasts will continue to improve over the 3 months following your surgery. Patience is often difficult for both physicians and patients, but be a patient patient! (Adam David Lowenstein, MD, FACS, Santa Barbara Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Bruising After Breast Augmentation</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_272" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Immediately after surgery the breasts can be swollen and appear overly full in the superior poles. The skin will be tight and most women who have had children state the sensation is very similar to when their milk comes in following delivery. At 2 weeks the breasts will have begun to soften and drop.</p><p>But it can take up to 6 weeks before they get to the point where they feel and appear completely natural. Patients are surprised at the difference between the breast appearance in the immediate post-operative period and the way they appear several months later, particularly in regards to size. The link below is to a breast augmentation case that’s similar to your own. (William F. DeLuca Jr, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It is not uncommon to swell after breast surgery as it may take 4-6 weeks for the implants to settle and take shape.</p><p>Saline implants can drop earlier than silicone gel implants over 3-6 weeks. (Rod J. Rohrich, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You will have significant swelling & bruising, especially in the upper poles of the breasts during the first week after breast surgery.</p><p>This seems to be especially notable when the implants are placed under the muscle. The implants will soften and settle into the breast skin envelope over the next 3 months.</p><p>Most of my patients see a resolution in the swelling at 3-4 weeks but the final shape of the breasts is not usually seen until 3 months. (William T. Stoeckel, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>6 weeks</h3><p>It is hard to comment on why your breasts are so much larger than expected. Hopefully, just swelling and I usually tell patients they will look great at a month and even better in 2-3 months.</p><p>If the bruising is in the upper aspect of the breast usually the muscle. The muscle will flatten out over the next few months and the breasts should look more natural. A 325cc implant should make you 1.5 cup sizes larger than you were before ultimately. (Joshua B. Hyman, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>When does the swelling go down after a breast surgery</h3><p>This is a very common concern following breast surgery. At five days, there will be profound swelling present underneath the muscle and even globally. Over the next several weeks as the pec muscle relaxes and the swelling subsides, you will have less volume in the upper pole of your breast. I tell my patients that at 3 months about 85-90% of the swelling will be gone.</p><p>It takes about a year for all of it to dissipate. As far as bra sizing goes, this is a very unpredictable variable due to the fact that there is no standardization among manufacturers of bras. I hope that you are happy with the size and shape of your breasts once the bruising has gone down. Please give us an update on this site so other patients can be educated. (Stephen M. Chen, MD, Richmond Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Bruising after breast surgery</h3><p>Recovery after breast surgery goes through several phases. The first week you will have the most amount of swelling. The implants will look too high and your breasts will feel very tight. During the next two weeks your breasts will begin to relax and they will start to feel more comfortable but there is still at least a 10-15% swelling factor.</p><p>Over the next 2-3 months your implants will “settle” into position. They will become soft and more supple. Nearly all of the swelling should be gone by the end of three months. At the end of three months you can go buy new bras. Have fun. (Ronald Schuster, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Swelling after breast augmentation</h3><p>I understand your concern but 5 days post op is too soon to know what size bra you will be in the end. Significant swelling & bruising can be present for 2 months after a breast surgery: Optimal results may not be seen for up to 6 months. Most plastic surgeons do not recommend that you be fitted for a bra before 6 weeks post breast surgery.</p><p>You should also understand that bra size should not be the only determining factor in whether you are happy with your surgery. You should feel good about your new silhouette, even if you do end up being a D cup size. Hopefully you and your surgeon discussed expectations of size, and even tried on different implants, before surgery. (Joseph Serota, MD, Aurora Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Too early to tell what cup size you will be</h3><p>Swelling can take 6 weeks to 3 months to fully go down. Generally, you can get a very good idea about your size at around 6 weeks after surgery. Don’t worry if you look bigger now just 5 days out from your surgery. Chances are, when the swelling goes down, you will be the exact size you wanted to be! (Richard H. Lee, MD, Newport Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Am I still swollen after breast surgery?</h3><p>Yes, you are still very swollen and the implants are likely still high riding on the chest making the breasts appear even larger. Don’t worry, this is very normal and I usually tell my patients that breasts won’t look normal for 6-8 weeks after surgery. Even after that, it may take up to 6 months for the breasts to really soften, round out and feel “natural” to you. So do not go out and buy expensive bras right now. Get something that is supportive and comfortable. Save the sexy bras for later once everything settles and you can pick the perfect size. Be patient and I am sure you will look great. (Erez Sternberg, MD, Jacksonville Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast swelling & bruising breast lift</h3><p>Breast bruising and swelling post lift can take up to 3+ months to resolve in some patients. Obviously everybody is different. But it will take 6-8 weeks for majority of patients to be close to the final shape and some patient far longer(tuberous defect,breast lifts etc).</p><p>If you have a submuscular placed implant expect a longer wait time. Also remember the thinner you are the more noticable the swelling. (Anire Okpaku, MD FACS, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>When does swelling subside after BA?</h3><p>Usually 3-4 weeks if under the muscle. But the final size and shape are not completely evident until 3-4 months after surgery.</p><p>The muscle is also thicker initially and will thin out over time. It definetely gets better over time as the implants settle. (Raj S. Ambay, MD, Brandon Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Determining cup size</h3><p>At this point in time of your recovery, it is normal to have bruising . Bruising & Swelling should subside at about 3 months. It is difficult to determine exact cup size pre and post-operatively.</p><p>Hopefully you will be plased with your results regardless of the cup size. Every manufacturer produces a variety of bra styles, which may differ in size and shape.</p><p>On this site, I do my best to give advice without a physical examination but I want you to know that a physical examination by a board certified physician is always the best way to get the most accurate information. (Tom J. Pousti, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Swelling after breast lift surgery can last longer</h3><p>After breast lift surgery, the swelling & bruising  usually increases for 3 or 4 days. After that the swelling starts to subside and majority of swelling has improved after 2 weeks. However, there is still significant amount of swelling left in the breast and it will continue to improve for up to 3 months.</p><p>In some patients, it can be seen even longer than that. Usually we do not recommend 100% committing to specific bra size up 9 to 12 months after the surgery as some surprise changes in breast size can still happen. (Boris Volshteyn, MD, MS, East Brunswick Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>When Does Swelling After breast lift Begin to Subside?</h3><p>After breast lift, the breasts will become moderately swollen and quite a bit firmer than normal, both from the presence of the addition volume of the implant, and also from the general puffiness that accompanies handling / traumatizing the chest wall tissues. The general direction the breast goes is less firmness, with relatively small decreases in absolute size as healing progresses. (Dan Downey, MD, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast lift does not cause swelling</h3><p>There should be very litle swelling after breast implant surgery. The breast is really not involved with the surgery, even with a nipple incision. Your breasts will get somewhat smaller in four weeks, but not much. (G. Gregory Gallico III, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>325 cc implants on your frame will give you a D cup</h3><p>After breast lift, there is usually very little swelling . Of course, your breasts will get a little smaller in the next couple of weeks. But I think your implants are just too big. The good new is that, as you get used to them, they will not seem so big. (George J. Beraka, MD (retired), Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Swelling & bruising will start to resolve 3 days after surgery, and 75% will be gone by 1 month. I usually recommend waiting until 1 month after surgery before buying any new bras or bathing suits. The implants and breast shape will settle over about 6 months while the last bit of swelling resolves. (Cory Goldberg, MD)</p></div>
