<h3>Finding the best plastic surgeon for breast augmentation</h3>
<p>Fortunately, with the advent of the internet, it is much easier to chose or narrow your choices.</p>
<p>Most surgeons have before and after galleries posted on the internet, and one can view the results.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you will find 2-3 surgeons whose work you like.</p>
<p>It it then necessary to view the qualifications of each surgeon.</p>
<p>In my opinion, to assure the highest level of &#8220;quality control&#8221;, choose a <strong>best plastic surgeon for breast augmentation</strong> who is certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery.</p>
<div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1007" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 210px"><meta itemprop="width" content="200"><meta itemprop="height" content="184"><img itemprop="url" itemprop="image" class="size-medium wp-image-1007" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Best-plastic-surgeon-for-breast-augmentation-choose-200x184.jpg" alt="Best plastic surgeon for breast augmentation choose" width="200" height="184" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Best plastic surgeon for breast augmentation choose</p></div>
<p>The consultation is really an &#8220;interview&#8221;. It is your chance to see if you like and trust this surgeon.</p>
<p>Remember, he/she is going to cut you open and place an implant under your breast. There is no turning back! Although cost is important, it should be last on your list.</p>
<p>There may be a wide range of prices available in your area, especially if you live in an area with high demand for cosmetic surgery. Common sense would dictate to find a price range which is &#8220;not too high&#8221; or &#8220;not too low&#8221;. (Brian Joseph, MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Start by choosing a board-certified best plastic surgeon for breast augmentation</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, in the cosmetic surgery market, &#8220;let the buyer beware&#8221; seems to be the watchword. In the Houston market, where I practice, there are dermatologists and ENT specialists performing breast augmentations in their offices. I saw an advertisement recently in Cosmetic Surgery Times, a medical publication, about a weekend breast augmentation course being offered by the International Society of Cosmetogynecology.</p>
<p>I would recommend talking with your family physician or gynecologist ,to find out if they had recommendations, speak with friends who&#8217;ve had breast augmentations, and look on the American Society of Plastic Surgeons website (www.plasticsurgery.org) to find surgeons in your area. In my practice, I perform between 125 and 150 breast augmentation a year, and have many patients who consults with two or three physicians. The most important thing for you is that you choose someone who is qualified and you have confidence in them (Joseph M. Perlman, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Choosing a best plastic surgeon for breast augmentation</h3>
<div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1011" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 210px"><meta itemprop="width" content="200"><meta itemprop="height" content="150"><img itemprop="url" itemprop="image" class="size-medium wp-image-1011" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Best-plastic-surgeon-for-breast-augmentation-pictures-after-200x150.jpg" alt="Best plastic surgeon for breast augmentation pictures after" width="200" height="150" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Best plastic surgeon for breast augmentation pictures after</p></div>
<p>I think its important for you to meet with more than one surgeon so you are confident you made the right choice. Look for the proper training in plastic surgery (board certification by the American Board of Plastic Surgery), beautiful results in the before & after photos so you can see the surgeon&#8217;s work, and that indefinable connection and confidence with your best plastic surgeon for breast augmentation.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t go for the &#8220;cheapest&#8221; price. Rather, consider the aforementioned paramaters, and ultimately choose the surgeon with whom you feel most comfortable. A great starting point: www.plasticsurgery.org. (Joseph M. Perlman, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Make sure the breast augmentation doctor is qualified first</h3>
<div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1010" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 210px"><meta itemprop="width" content="200"><meta itemprop="height" content="113"><img itemprop="url" itemprop="image" class="size-medium wp-image-1010" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Best-plastic-surgeon-for-breast-augmentation-after-surgery-200x113.jpg" alt="Best plastic surgeon for breast augmentation after surgery" width="200" height="113" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Best plastic surgeon for breast augmentation after surgery</p></div>
<p>If you know someone who has had a good experience, of course, you can use that as a starting point. You should make sure any doctor you are planning to see is a board certified plastic surgeon. You can be assured of this if they are a member of either the American Society of Plastic Surgeons or the American Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (or both).</p>
<p>You can search for local doctors in these organizations by going to their web sites. Then interview 2 or 3 of these doctors to see who you are most comfortable with and see lots of their before and after pictures. (C. Bob Basu, MD, FACS, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Choosing Your top rated plastic surgeon</h3>
<p>I get this question asked alot of times. It is also a very good and important question. First, you must seek out a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery.</p>
<p>Be very careful about doctors claiming to be &#8220;board certified&#8221;, they may not be board certified in Plastic Surgery (example Ob/gyn).</p>
<p>At your consultation, make sure you are comfortable with your surgeon and he answers all of your questions you may have about your surgery.</p>
<p>Ask a lot of questions, you have the right to be as informed as possible with the surgery.</p>
<p>Make sure he explains the risks and potential complications involved with your surgery as well. It is also important that you are comfortable with the staff at the office. How did they treat you? What was your impression of the office after you left?</p>
<p>Ask to look at your surgeons before/ after pictures and to speak with their former patients if you want. They should be very willing to do so. Another important factor to consider is where will the surgery be performed and who will be delivering your anesthesia?</p>
<p>Make sure the facility is AAAASF certified or at a hospital and your anesthia provider is a Board Certified Anesthesioligist. And finally ask if you physician has staff privileges at a hospital to perform these types of procedures. (Talmage J. Raine, MD, Champaign Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Choosing a Plastic Surgeon for Breast Augmentation</h3>
<p>The initial consultation for breast augmentation should begin with a careful history and physical examination, followed by extensive discussion of your own and your surgeon&#8217;s aesthetic goals for breast augmentation.</p>
<p>During this discussion, you should decide not only on the surgeon&#8217;s credentials but also their commitment to creating and maintaining natural looking breasts with normal contour. Board certification in Plastic Surgery is a minimum requirement. (Talmage J. Raine, MD, Champaign Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Tips for finding top rated breast augmentation surgeons</h3>
<p>This is a very common question. Oftentime patients are overwhelmed with the vast number of surgeons available to perform cosmetic procedures. First and foremost, it is important to find a qualified surgeon.</p>
<p>There are many surgeons out there who can perform cosmetic surgery, but you should be aware that not all of them have extensive training in plastic surgery. A good place to start your search is at the American Board of Plastic Surgery at www.plasticsurgery.org. These surgeons have been certified and are recognized by the American Medical Board for their extensive education and training in the field of plastic surgery. They also are required to follow a strict guideline for ethics and patient saftey. From there, it is important to meet with several different surgeons &#8212; ask the hard questions and review before and after pictures. Select a surgeon that makes you feel comfortable and provides you with realistic expectations. Another great way to select a surgeon is through patient referrals. Ask you friends or family members who have had breast augmentation. Schedule consultations with the doctors who have provided a great experience and a natural looking result. From there, again, ask the hard questions, check his or her credentials and make sure you feel comfortable with the surgeon and facilitlies. (Amy T. Bandy, DO, FACS, Newport Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Satisfaction is more than the fee!</h3>
<p>I advise all my patients to be sure that they can communicate well with their plastic surgeon and that the surgeon has excellent experience and track record which they can share with you. They should be happy to share their complication rate with you and to contrast this with the national rate of various risks such as deflation and need for touch up surgery.</p>
<p>Speak with patients they have treated by phone to confirm your feelings before you choose them and make sure you like the before and after photos they show you including they way the scar appears! Do they cover the cost of any touch up surgery that may be needed? Satisfaction is more than the fee. It is all about the results! (Steven Yarinsky, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Plastic Surgeon Search</h3>
<p>Talk to friends/family if you know that they have have surgery, even if they do not live in your hometown; remember to gather as much information, good and bad, as you can. The internet is a great resource, but, there is all kinds of information that needs to be appropriately sifted through.</p>
<p>Identify the best surgeon for breast augmentation who performs a significant number of the procedure your are interested in (it may be local or you may need to travel); start with Amercian Society of Plastic Surgeons website to help with your search (www.plasticsurgery.org.). Most importantly, after you have armed yourself with enough information, go see the surgeon, talk to him/her, review their before and after portfolio.and make a judgement on whether you &#8220;feel&#8221; confident and comfortable that your surgeon can deliver the result you are looking for. (Steven Yarinsky, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>High quality breast augmentation requires an extensive consultation and surgical expertise</h3>
<p>There are many variables in getting your optimal result for breast enhancement. Many of the issues are related to the exact shape and size of your breasts and your overall body habitus. Equally important are the issues between your ears, i.e. your exact expectations and body image perceptions in your mind.</p>
<p>This is why the consultation is so important. It should be open-ended for time and issues; a second session is not. The surgical procedure is commonly straight forward once the goals of the consultation have been decided upon. We are using approximately 75% silicone and 25% saline implants at present.</p>
<p>Ultimately the choice of silicone or saline is with the patient. We go under the muscle about 98% of the time except for very specific, and rare, reasons. We always use a pain pump for augmentations made by On-Q. This changes the entire experience in a very positive.</p>
<p>You should ask around and find the surgeons that are recommended over and over again. Word of mouth speaks volumes. Look for board certification by The American Board of Plastic Surgery. All the best in achieving positive changes in your body image. (John Philip Connors III, MD, FACS, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Finding the best surgeon for breast augmentation</h3>
<p>To be sure that you are choosing <strong>the best surgeon for breast augmentation</strong>, I would recommend that you start by researching the credentials of the doctors that you are considering. Be sure that you are considering surgeons who are Board Certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgeons, and then look at what Societies that they are members of.</p>
<p>The American Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons allows only Board Certified Plastic Surgeons who do the majority of their surgery in cosmetic surgery cases to be members if this exclusive Society. I would then meet with the doctors, and carefully look at their before and after photos, as a picture speaks 1000 words.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you are still uncertain, ask if you can speak with a patient that they have performed surgery on. If the surgeon does not provide you with a large volume of photos to look at, or cannot give you a patient of theirs to talk to, you may want to keep looking! (John Philip Connors III, MD, FACS, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Breast augmentation and surgeon choice</h3>
<p>I agree with the other responders, your plastic surgeon should be board certified. Prior to a consultation you can look at the website to see if their results are consistent with what you are looking for.</p>
<p>Then schedule a consultation. The purpose of the consultation is to be educated about the procedure including operative experience and risks and complications, see results of before and after, be evaluated to determine that you are a good candidate and lastly and equally important do you feel comfortable with the physician. It is easy to ask to speak to a previous patient to get their input as well about the procedure and the physician. (Otto Joseph Placik, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Breast augmentation best surgeon</h3>
<p>Do your homework. Look for a board certified PS with good reputation, meet with PS, ask your questions, evaluate the PS opinion, most important do feel good about the information, do you feel conected, is your PS available all the time to you (I give my home numeber to all my patients). That is your best PS. (Otto Joseph Placik, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>How to find the breast augmentation best plastic surgeon</h3>
<p>There is no &#8220;best&#8221; breast augmentation plastic surgeon, but what you can do is educate yourself. Here&#8217;s a link to a series of videos and blog posts on the subject, including what questions to ask, and what to look at your own chest in the mirror before you even go see the breast augmentation best surgeon. (Marisa Lawrence, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Breast augmentation best surgeon: Board Certified is a Must</h3>
<p>At a minimum, you should be sure to research the doctor&#8217;s qualifications and medical record with the American Society of Plastic Surgeons and the California Medical Boad. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons is a great resource for finding more information on general plastic surgery as well as procedural information and statistics.</p>
<p>In addition, check with friends and family to see if they can recommend anyone. And, make sure to ask to see before and after photos. Also, you should ask them how long they have been performing the procedure for. (Marisa Lawrence, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Finding a breast augmentation best surgeon</h3>
<p>The first step would be to ask friends or your physician for a recommendation. If this is not feasible, search the ASAPS and ASPS web sites. These will list only board-certified plastic surgeons. You may also find links on these sites to the surgeons&#8217;s web sites which will give you more information as well as pre- and post-op photos in some cases.</p>
<p>Make certain that your surgeon has privileges to perform the surgery in a hospital if he/she suggests a nonhospital setting for your surgery. (Roger J. Friedman, MD, Bethesda Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Finding the best plastic surgeon for breast augmentation</h3>
<p>With the insurance reimbursements going lower and lower, a lot of physicians are offering cosmetic surgery services including breast implants. You have to ask yourself Is this doctor offering these services to supplement his income or is this procedure he is offering to do, part of the core training that he has received in residency.</p>
<p>A plastic surgeon certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery has had a minimum of 3 to 5 years of training in general surgery and an additional 2 to 3 years of draining in plastic surgery. These docyors are real surgeons capable of operating anywhere in the body and deal with any complications. Having said that, all plastic surgeons aren&#8217;t equal they specialize in different areas of the body.</p>
<p>I would go to a breast augmentation best surgeon who does a lot breast work both cosmetic and reconstructive. Breast augmentation involves more that placing an implant. There are a lot of factors coming into play. You go for a consultation and ask a lot of questions, see a lot of picture. Make sure that the pictures are in the 3 standard views. Its your body don&#8217;t let the price decide who to go to. If you do that it may cost you more in the long run. And a lot of aggravation. (Roger J. Friedman, MD, Bethesda Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not easy finding the best doctor to treat you for any reason and it&#8217;s especially difficult to find the right cosmetic surgeon.</p>
<p>Lots of physicians are claiming to be experts in cosmetic surgery and many are not qualified to treat you. My article &#8220;How to choose the right plastic surgeon&#8221; covers what you need to know to find a qualified surgeon.</p>
<p>Regarding breast augmentation specifically, make sure the physician performs the surgery regularly and has pre and post op photos to show you.</p>
<p>There have been many recent advances in this particular procedure, including new implants with various &#8220;profiles&#8221;, so make sure he or she keeps up with the latest trends. (James H. Schmidt, MD, Sarasota Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Finding the Best plastic surgeons for breast augmentation</h3>
<p>Finding the best breast augmentation surgeon is a difficult quesiton to answer with no formula. It requires alot of homework and eventually it requires a relationship that can vary in different situations and conditions.</p>
<p>The patient and physician personality match is a very important factor in addition to technical skills and experience and training.</p>
<p>It is also important to realize that not all aspects of this surgery can be controlled with 100% certainty. Beginning with a board certified plastic surgeon is probably one of the first most important steps. There are many resources and one of the best is www.plasticsurgery.org. (Jeffrey Horowitz, MD, Bel Air Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Research Your Doctor for breast augmentation</h3>
<p>Picking the right doctor for you can be challenging. There are so many things to consider. Here are a few tips to make this important decision easier. Choose a doctor certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery. Many doctors perform &#8220;cosmetic surgery&#8221;.</p>
<p>You want a surgeon who has completed a rigorous training program and has demonstrated good clinical judgment and skills. The American Board of Plastic Surgery confirms that a surgeon has meet these criteria. Is the doctor on staff at the local hospitals, and is your surgeon allowed to perform your type of surgery in these hospitals?</p>
<p>Your local hospital performs a thorough review process before giving a surgeon privileges to perform any type of surgery. If your surgeon can perform this surgery at a local hospital, that surgeon has passed the credentialing process at that institution. You can call your local hospital, ask for the medical staff office and check to see of you physician has the appropriate credentials. Get recommendations. Ask your personal physician and/or friends. Most physicians know who the reputable doctors are in a community.</p>
<p>Likewise, if you have friends who have had similar surgery, ask them if they had a good experience. Schedule a consultation. During that visit, see if you can communicate with the doctor. Is he/she listening to your concerns and desires. Do you feel comfortable with this doctor? Ask to see photos of previous patients. Does the doctor perform this surgery on a regular basis? Ask if you can talk with previous patients.</p>
<p>Where does the doctor perform the surgery? It should be in a safe certified setting such a hospital or licensed ambulatory surgery center. Be cautious about having surgery in an unlicensed office operating room that may not have the appropriate safety equipment and procedures. I hope the above will help you choose the best doctor for you. This is an important decision so do your home work. Do not pick the doctor with the flashy advertising or with the smoothest sales pitch. Make an objective decision. (James H. Schmidt, MD, Sarasota Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>The best breast surgeon for breast augmentation</h3>
<p>Aside from credentials, years in practice, and hospital pictures, look at the surgeon&#8217;s photo gallery of before and after results. Also ask to speak to patients in the practice.</p>
<p>Alot of doctors perform breast augmentations but choose one who will spend time with you discussing your goals. There is alot of information to review for this procedure and you want to have everything you need to make the right decision for yourself. (Jeffrey Horowitz, MD, Bel Air Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Best breast augmentation surgeon</h3>
<p>There are many aspects to finding a well qualified surgeon. Always check into thier credentials and board certifications. Many physicians call themselves cosmetic surgeons without formal training.</p>
<p>A plastic surgeon has specialized training and when they are a member of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons ( ASPS) they have also completed specialized testeing showing proficiency in thier field.</p>
<p>Feel comfortable in your consultation. You should walk out of a consult being well informed and feeling like your surgeon was giving you all the information to pick the right procedure and size for your body.</p>
<p>Look at pictures Finally, referals and talking to other patients is the best way to get an idea of the surgeons work and bedside manner. (James Barber, MD, Pittsburgh Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Finding the Best Breast Augmentation Surgeon</h3>
<p>When looking for a plastic surgeon in your area, talk to other patients who have had similar operations and compare their experiences.</p>
<p>Once you have a few names, research them on the internet to make sure they are board certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery. Then make a few appointments for consultation and hopefully you will find a surgeon who you are happy with.</p>
<p>It is also good to talk to the other patients in the waiting room to see if they are happy with their results and interactions with the surgeon. (James Barber, MD, Pittsburgh Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Finding the Right Surgeon</h3>
<p>To start with you need to look at the credentials. Make sure they are board certified plastic surgeon. Second, look a the before and after photos. See if you like their results. That is an important part of the whole picture. And lastly, do you feel comfortable with the surgeon? When all three have been satisfied they you have found your surgeon. Do not go solely by cost as some others do. You are asking to problems and in the long term, the cost of your procedure will even out and you may be left with a lesser result. (Jay Calvert, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Finding the best breast surgeons</h3>
<p>Picking a plastic surgeon to perform breast augmentation is an important decision. Choose a physician that is board certified in plastic and reconstructive surgery by the American Board of Plastic Surgery. Experience with your desired procedure is also very important. Ask the doctor how many times they have performed the procedure.</p>
<p>It is helpful to look at the physicians before and after photos and talk with patients from the practice that have had the surgery. When you come in for your consultation and meet the physician, it is important that the physician is willing to take the time to address your questions and concerns regarding the procedure. The rapport between you and the physician is an important part of your surgical experience. Another important component to the procedure is the facility in which it will be performed.</p>
<p>The operating room should be certified by either Medicare, JCAHO or AAAHC. In summary, take the time to familiarize yourself with the process so you can make the best informed decision possible. (Jay Calvert, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p>
