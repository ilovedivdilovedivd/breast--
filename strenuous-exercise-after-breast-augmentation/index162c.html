During exercise your heart rate and blood pressure increase and this could eventually cause bleeding in the operative area that may require surgical intervention. After having an surgery it is important to protect the good cosmetic result. (Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>As noted by some of the surgeons below, we understand our patients’ desire to return to vigorous activity.</p><p>I encourage my patients to walk and do lower body stretching almost immediately if they wish.</p><p>I ask them to refrain from vigorous aerobic activity like spinning, or rapid uphill walking for the first two weeks since this could delay resolution of breast augmentation swelling.</p><p>By three weeks patients can start returning to their usual workouts but not overdoing shoulder or chest work until the fifth or sixth week. An easy rule of thumb is to avoid any activity that hurts.</p><p>One important reason for avoiding early upper body stress is the possibility of late bleeding. (William McClure, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I ask my patients to wait 4 weeks. In some who are healing well, we can talk about recumbent bike at low levels in week 3. I would recommend you follow your PS instructions for the best result. (Mahlon Kerr, MD, FACS, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I can understand your concern and frustration about not being able to exercise after breast implants. I recomend to my patients that they avoid exercise that is going to raise thier heart rate and blood pressure in the first week post surgery. They are allowed to walk or perform low intensity cardio workouts. Strictly no upper body exercise or running for 4 weeks.After a week they can start to increase thier level of exercise and I usually recommend they start with low intensity workouts on a stationary bike (spin or bike on a trainer but not on a roller). (Vijith Vijayasekaran, MBBS, FRACS, Perth Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Many of our patients are very fitness oriented and exercise is an important part of their lifestyle, so taking time off from the gym is difficult.However, you have invested a large amount of money, time and effort into getting your breast implants. Do not destroy your results because you are impatient and want to get back to the gym rightaway.</p><p>Understand that no matter what you do, how your surgery was done, who your surgeon was. your body (any human body) goes through the same healing process. It takes 6 weeks for any tissue to regain sufficient strength to withstand day to day activities. Before that time, you risk breaking open your wounds, dislodging your implants from where they are supposed to sit etc.</p><p>Low impact exercises (which do not shake your implants, do not flex your pec muscles excessively) can be started about 2-3 weeks after the surgery, but absolutely stay away from strenuous exercise for about 6 weeks. (Martin Jugenburg, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>When I trained my attending a recommended similar restrictions as the ones you mention. With extra training in cosmetic breast surgery and for the past 15 years post implanted women have enjoyed activity, working out, elliptical, spin, aerobics, and yoga after 48-72 hours.</p><p>Who does the surgery, how the technique is performed, and the closure are critical to early return to full activity. (Peter J. Capizzi, MD, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Working out after breast implants</h3><p>By all means you should follow your plastic surgeons advice. They are familiar with their own technique and what works best in their hands. That being said, most patients can slowly start exercising at about 2 weeks.</p><p>They can walk as much as they want to from day 1. They should not lift more than 20 pounds with their arms for 3 weeks. Listen to your body, it won’t guide you wrong. (Dustin L. Reid, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>First of all – you should follow your own surgeon’s instructions. I do not allow my patients to do any exercise forat least 2-3 weeks because of the rare possibility of late bleeding. After three weeks I allow my patients to do non-impact cardio (like stationary bike, elliptical without using arms, stairmaster) as well as core and lower body training.</p><p>I do not want patients to flex their chest muscles through stretching or lifting for 6-8 weeks especially if the implants were placed beneath the muscle. (Ronald Schuster, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The best answer is to do what your surgeon recommends. They know what they have done in terms of specific surgical procedures, and are the best ones to recommend when you can get back to using a stationary bike.</p><p>Personally, I allow my BBA patients to begin low impact exercise after 2-3 weeks. I encourage them to avoid high impact workouts for 6 weeks.</p><p>Everyone has their own voodoo – you should follow that prescribed by your operating surgeon. (Asif Pirani, MD, FRCS(C), Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Every doctor has his/her own protocol for resuming activities after surgery. The bottom line, however, is that you need to let your tissues recover from the trauma of the surgery before you resume strenuous activity.</p><p>Having paid a lot of money to get a result, you don’t want to jeopardize that result. If it is more important to you to work out than to adhere to your doctor’s recovery plan then you probably should not have the surgery. (Edwin C. Pound, III, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It is very exciting to look forward to enlarging your breasts. The difficulty exists though post operatively when during your recovery when you can’t be as active as you would like. Especially, since you are so diligent and have an interest in your health, very commendable.</p><p>Typically, I recommend not exercising for at least two weeks after surgery and even longer at times. First of all, increasing your heart rate and blood pressure too early after surgery can lead to more bruising or even delayed bleeding.</p><p>Secondly, impact from cardio exercises can affect your healing especially with more and more people getting textured implants. </p><p>The constant impact can potentially dislodge the healing of the tissue to the textured implant and can lead to rotation that could have been avoided.</p><p>So, to be safe, at least two to three weeks, then slowly begin to incorporate exercises and let your body help let you know how much you can do. Make sure to ask your surgeon before any exercising. (Joel B. Beck, MD, FACS, Bay Area Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I personally highly recommend no exercising for about a month (4 weeks) after a breast augmentation. After 2 weeks you can start doing LIGHT cardio, but always remember that even if you only work out your “legs”, your body is still healing from a surgery so you don’t want to get the blood rushing or the heart pumping too much while your still in that healing process. Always ask your doctor what he thinks as you go following up. (Mel T. Ortega, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Best healing after breast augmentation</h3><p>I have found the most attractive breast augmentation results are seen in women that have stopped working out completely for at least 4 weeks after surgery. Many patients have told us the exact same thing as you have, but when fully healed say, “it was worth it”. This advice has worked best for our competitive athletes, as well as non-professional athletes that usually work out every day. It is important. (George John Alexander, MD, FACS, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Working out after Surgery</h3><p>The other doctors that were before me seem to have it down. follow your doctor’s orders. If you want to have the best Aesthetic results possible you need to follow instructions. It is tough when we have a routine in life and we have to deviate from that but it can be done. If this is worth it to you, follow the instructions. You are making a huge investment in your body. (Miguel Delgado, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>A stitch in time</h3><p>Like my father always said, “a stitch in time saves nine”. Protecting your investment and allowing your body to heal will avoid complications and unnecessary problems. I tell my pts to wait 2.5 weeks to start sweating and get their heart rate up. At that point, I like them to power walk and build up to jogging by 3-4 weeks.</p><p>An athlete knows that rest is critical to recovery and getting energized. Use this time to read a book, spend time with loved ones or learn something new. My personal favorite is getting a hot chocolate with my kids and hanging out for 30 minutes at a local chocolate shop! Keep a healthy diet and you will be fine and return refreshed and looking good! (Matthew H. Conrad, MD, Wichita Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Consult with your surgeon about the types of activities that are acceptable post-surgery. My own personal recommendations to my patients are start walking as much as you want to, as soon as you want to.</p><p>Then progress as desired to high-reps, low-resistance exercises. Slowly progress for 6 weeks, after which time there are no restrictions.</p><p>I advise my patients to refrain from strenuous physical activity such as heavy lifting with your arms or jogging for 6 weeks.</p><p>It is important that you follow your doctor’s instructions so that you get the best aesthetic results. (Larry S. Nichter, MD, MS, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Working out after Breast Surgery</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1657" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The first week after surgery, most patients do not feel “up to” working out. Usually, 2-3 weeks after breast surgery, some patients start with lower body exercising. I recommend no upper body workouts until everything has healed and the breast implants have settled. Communicate with your surgeon and follow his/her instructions. (Tom J. Pousti, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Strenuous Exercising after breast surgery</h3><p>Believe it or not, many physical activities that do not seem to involve the upper body do require upper body strength and movement. It is important to discuss these concerns with your surgeon prior to the surgery to receive your physician’s recommendations. Breast augmentation surgery often involves an incision under the breast along the crease between the breast and the rib cage.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1659" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Cycling often involves supporting yourself with your upper body and a forward-leaning position that can inhibit healing. It is important to allow your body to heal. I suggest following your surgeon’s orders and avoid strenuous exercise for as long as he or she recommends. (David Whiteman, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Exercise and breast surgery</h3><p>One can be back doing routine excercise within 2-3 weeks after breast surgery. In primary breast surgery, I recommend not to get your heart rate above 100 for the first 2 weeks. After that, one can resume most activities by 3-4 weeks. (Rod J. Rohrich, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Exercise Post-Op surgery</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1656" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>You should follow the recommendations of your surgeon on this one – my patients only get to walk–meaning not increase heart rate for 4 weeks and then gently return to full activity at 6-8 weeks. Missing this time in the gym is only for your safety. And the complications that arise from doing too much too soon only keep you out of the gym longer. Please seek the guidance of your surgeon as you heal. (Thomas B. Lintner, MD, FACS, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Exercise after breast augmentation or enlargement</h3><p>See video below by clicking “Exercise after breast augmentation or enlargement.” Exercise can be performed but only under the strict supervision of your physician. In fact we highly advise that certain exercises be performed immediately to lessen post-operative pain and discomfort. Discuss your concerns with your surgeon (Otto Joseph Placik, MD, )</p><h3>Please follow your surgeon’s instructions</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1658" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-c7b3e0b9854ed013c1592278f6f706f4">

</div><p>Do you notice a pattern in the answers here? Although I feel you that not working out sucks for those of us who regularly do so, you need to take it easy after your surgery to reduce the chances of things going wrong. (John P. Di Saia, MD, Orange Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The bottom line here is you need to follow your doctor’s orders. If you have been told to refrain from exercise for three weeks and cannot adhere to that request then you should not have the surgery.</p><p>Your surgeon is trying to do his or her best for you. Your part in this agreement is to follow orders. (Edmond A. Zingaro, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Strenuous Exercise with Breast Implants</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1660" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Believe it or not, Implants can be affected by all sorts of activities. Consult with your surgeon about your exercise schedule. A stationary bike does work your stomach and could mess with your new breasts. One good exercise for you would be simple but effective leg lifts.</p><p>Lay flat on your back, keep your leg straight and let it rest about six inches off the ground for 15-20 seconds. Then pull your knee into your body and see how high you can kick up with out bending your knee. Then switch. It seems simple buts it’s really quite good. (Kimberly A. Henry, MD, Greenbrae Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The amount of time it takes you to recover from breast surgery will depend on your body’s ability to heal.</p><p>Typically, I encourage my patients to engage in only light activity for 1 to 2 weeks after surgery.</p><p>This includes very light walking and daily activities, such as household chores. At 2 weeks, exercise intensity can gradually be increased.</p><p>Vigorous activity is usually restricted for about 6 weeks after surgery to avoid injury.</p><p>I would recommend checking in with your surgeon regularly throughout your recovery and following his or her recommendations based on how you’re healing. (Thomas McNemar, MD, FACS, San Ramon Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I advise my patients to wait three weeks before exercising after a breast surgery which will allow your body plenty of time to heal and control the amount of swelling in the breast area.</p><p>Furthermore, I advise my patients to begin with a low impact exercise routine such as the stationary bike or elliptical machine and wait 4-6 weeks to begin running or other high impact exercise. (Mark Deutsch, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Activity following breast surgery</h3><p>Every surgeon has his or her own routine instructions regarding exercising after breast surgery. Most of the instructions center around lessening the movement of the arms and chest. Many surgeons advise not to lift your elbows above your shoulders and restrict what you lift to five pounds or less.</p><p>Normally within a week to ten days, most patients can return to activities such as using a stationary bike. It’s best not to allow sweat to gather around your wounds. The increase in blood associated with heavy exercise can lead to more and prolonged swelling in the fresh, healing wounds of the breast.</p><p>It is very important to follow the instructions given to you by your doctor. (John J. Edney, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Exercise following breast surgery</h3><p>Most patients can perform some mild cardio at 2 weeks with full cardio at 6 weeks. I don’t allow any heavy lifting with the arms for 6 weeks. (Kurtis Martin, MD, Cincinnati Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Working out after breast surgery</h3><p>It is important to take the advice of the surgeon doing the operation. In the first few days, it’s important to take it easy so as to not increase your blood pressure, which can lead to bleeding around the implant.</p><p>Patients are generally able to return to work after 1 week, but it is not advisable to lift anything over 10 pounds for the first 4 weeks.</p><p>After that, it is reasonable to return to the gym and slowly restart your workout regime, working you way back up to where you were before. (Kunaal Jindal, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You need to talk to your surgeon. However, after the first week, patients have usually healed enough that I allow them to do cardio exercises that do not involve the arms, such as a stationary bike. However, healing can take longer depending on what was done at surgery, so you should check with your surgeon. (Thomas A. Mustoe, MD, FACS, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
