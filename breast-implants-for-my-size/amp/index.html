</div><p>Based on these photos and the use of sizers, I will be able to accurately figure out which implants would be best for you to achieve your goal. (Tom J. Pousti, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Finding the right size for a breast augmentation</h3><p>Breast augmentation surgery is a very popular and effective way to safely increase the size of your breasts and change their contour. One of the most important decisions that woman needs to make before the surgery is selecting the size of the breast implant. Many offices have their own techniques in doing this.</p><p>In our practice, we commonly use a combination of digital photography and allowing the patient to personally try on a wide range of implants under their clothes. This gives women the opportunity to see how the implants will change their figure and their appearance in their clothes. To learn more about breast augmentation, see photos, and help you decide which one is best for you, please visit us at the link below. (Pat Pazmino, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2390" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>There are many different ways to choose breast implants: trying on different size implants in a bra, looking at before and after photos of other patients similar to you or going by your surgeons’s recommendation. These methods are commonly used but you may still never quite be able to visualize how you will look with a certain size breast implant. There is a technology available however, which can photograph you then recreate a 3D image using special software and cameras to simulate what you may look like with various size breast implants.</p><p>This method takes a lot of the guesswork out of selecting implant sizes because you can actually see, on your own body, what the implants look like. We recently acquired this system and patients find it extremely helpful in selecting the best implant for themselves, because they can now “see” it. Consult with a board certified plastic surgeon prior to scheduling a breast augmentation procedure. (William Bruno, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Getting the right implant size</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2391" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>During the breast augmentation consultation, you desired size and pesent size is considered. Then a series of measurements of the chest and the breasts are taken.</p><p>Then the different types of implants available are considered and the ideal shape and size range that fits your body wil be presented to you. (Samir Shureih, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Choosing the right implant for you requires a full physical exam, and medical history. Assessing your anatomy and your desires will help determine the correct implant for you. (Steven Wallach, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You already have an image in your mind of what you want – the hardest thing to do is to describe that image in words.</p><p>During my augmentation consultations I take measurements of the breasts and chest in order to give you a range of implant sizes that I can use that would work with your body.</p><p>Then I have my assistants help you try on sizers until you see in the mirror the same image that you already have in your mind.</p><p>That is how you determine the <strong>best size for breast implants</strong> that you need. I will sometimes adjust that size minimally depending on our discussion and only with your consent and knowledge. (Richard H. Fryer, MD, Salt Lake City Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast implant sizing.</h3><p>From your description, you are about 5′ tall, 103lbs with A cup breasts and wish to be a C cup. This is definitely a possibility for you. The selection of implants is based upon the characteristics of your breasts. These characteristics include:</p><ol>
<li>Width of the breast</li>
<li>Elasticity of the breast skin</li>
<li>Location of the nipples</li>
<li>Amount of breast tissue present</li>
<li>Goals of the patient.</li>
</ol><p>With these measurements and qualities in hand, the implant is chosen that fits both your anatomy and your goals. Placement of the implants depends on the ability to “hide” the implant under the breast. Even the placement of the incision is variable. Today, the options for implants are enormous and are not simply limited to saline versus silicone. Please schedule a consultation with a board certified plastic surgeon to see what options are right for you. (David Bogue, MD, Boca Raton Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Determining the Best Size for Breast Implants</h3><p>When deciding to undergo breast augmentation, many patients are concerned with choosing the right size breast implants. The size you choose is ultimately up to you and your preferences, although it is important to be advised of additional side effects – such as stretch marks for going too large.</p><p>Also the best size for breast implants of your implant may affect the incision site you choose for your surgery if you choose silicone breast implants. To help determine a size, it is recommended that you bring in pictures of the sizes you like so that your plastic surgeon can see proportionately the type of look you desire.</p><p>Another way to determine your <em>best size for breast implants</em> is by “trying on” implants. It is important to note that this is just to determine the look you desire, not the exact number of cc’s as the appearance will change once the implant is placed under the muscle. (Tarick K. Smaili, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Choosing the best size breast implant</h3><p>Bra sizes are not standard and women can wear bras loose or tight, so a “C” may or may not be what you want. What you really want is a breast implant that provides the look that you want – regardless of the bra that you wear. I have patients try implants on under clothing so they can experience the actual implant before surgery.</p><p>We take into account the dimensions of the implant and your particular anatomy to make recommendations. Although not perfect, this method is the best I have tried. Your plastic surgeon will be able to help you select an implant that is just right. (Randy J. Buckspan, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How to figure out best breast implant size</h3><p>It sounds like the augmentation that you are hoping for is certainly a possibility. However, I strongly encourage patients to let go of “cup size” expectations and try on the sizers to see what they like the look of.</p><p>I measure the width of the breast “footprint” on the chest wall to determine guidelines for the widest implant that I recommend, but then I let patients take their time in front of the mirror with our sizers.</p><p>Its far more important to like what you see in the mirror than the number/letter on the tag of your bra! (Amy M. Sprole, MD, Wichita Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Choosing the best implant size for breast augmentation</h3><p>There are numerous factors that need to be considered when choosing the appropriate implant size. Implants come in volumes measured in cubic centimeters (“cc’s”), not cup sizes. Your own anatomy including breast width, skin quality, and amount of tissue coverage will influence implant selection. (Olivia Hutchinson, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Implant Size</h3><p>There are many factors you and your plastic surgeon must take into consideration when deciding on Your IDEAL Breast Implant Size.</p><p>1. Current Breast Width and Soft Tissue Coverage: The most important consideration when deciding on breast implant size is the amount of soft tissue you have available to cover the implant.</p><p>Very thin patients with thin skin and little breast tissue or subcutaneous fat will not be able to safely accommodate a large implant without risking a visible and palpable implant, chest wall deformity, thinning of the overlying tissues, and possible exposure of the implant. During your consultation, your plastic surgeon will most likely take measurements and do thorough examination to determine which breast implants you can safely receive.</p><p>2. Nipple Location: Patients with sagging breasts and low nipples may need a larger implant than expected if they wish to decrease the appearance of breast sagging while avoiding additional incisions on the breasts.</p><p>3. Skin Laxity: Patients with a very tight skin envelope may not be able to accept a large implant; conversely, patients with loose skin may look more appropriate with a larger breast implant.</p><p>4. Desired Size and Shape: Patients who want a large increase in size and more fullness of the upper breast may consider a larger, high-profile implant. Those patients desiring a moderate increase in size with a more natural look should consider a smaller, low- or moderate-profile implant, or even an anatomically-shaped implant.</p><p>Additionally, there are several ways to get an idea of Your DESIRED Size, Shape and Appearance.</p><p>1. Try on Sizers: Many plastic surgeons may have breast implant sizers available for you to try on during your consultation or preoperative visit. This will give you an idea of the volume necessary to get your desired appearance in clothing.</p><p>2. Look at Pictures: Many patients find that bringing pictures from magazines or the Internet aids in their discussion with their plastic surgeon when talking about breast implant size, shape, and characteristics.</p><p>3. Talk with Friends and Previous Patients: Obviously, you should not pick an implant size based on what your friends or family received. However, it doesn’t hurt to get an idea of the size range you think is attractive by speaking to friends and family members of a similar build who have also undergone breast augmentation. In general, 150-200cc of implant volume are required to give a 1-cup size increase in breast volume. Thus, if you are an A-cup and wish to go to a C-cup, you may need a 300-400cc breast implant. These are very rough estimates and vary depending on patient height, chest width, weight, etc. In the United States, the most common breast implant sizes range from about 275cc to 400cc; these volumes are slightly lower in Europe and slightly higher in South American countries. However, the most important step in picking out a breast implant size is to have an honest discussion with your plastic surgeon and to undergo a thorough physical examination. And remember, depending on your breast and tissue characteristics, your DESIRED breast implant size may not be your IDEAL breast implant size. Be sure to schedule a consultation with a plastic surgeon certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery who is experienced in breast implant surgery. (Jaime Perez, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The most appropriate implant for a particular woman is determined by considering her desired size, current size, looseness/tightness of the soft tissues of the chest, and chest dimensions.</p><p>You are petite. It is not clear how broad your chest and shulders are, though you state your arms are “big”. If your chest is narrow, but soft tissues are loose-ish, you may be able to get to a C with a moderate or high profile implant.</p><p>If your chest is broad, one of the moderate or low profile implants may work.</p><p>If the soft tissues are very tight, you may have to sacrifice a “natural” look to attain a C cup. These are all issues to discuss with your Plastic Surgeon. (Robert Stroup, Jr., MD, FACS, Cleveland Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How do I find the correct size breast implant?</h3><p>The correct size is the size that you like. The trick is for your surgeon to determine what you have in mind. Often patients will have a predetermined cup size as you do. There are basically 4 cup sizes, however, and there are numerous breast sizes.</p><p>So up to a point different breast volumes can fit into a C cup, the size you desire to have. The best way to determine what you like is to put different size implants into an unpadded bra, put a sweater on and look in the mirror.</p><p>With the help of your doctor, you should come close to what looks good to you. Don’t get hung-up on the cup size excessively, as different brands may be either tighter or looser on your breast. Most importantly, it has to look right for you in the mirror.</p><p>Bring a friend to help you decide if you think it will help. I sounds like you are muscular so you must exercise. I would not go too large if you continue pectoralis exercises a lot.</p><p>I have found that this tends to casue an increase in encapsulation rate. A smaller implant looks much more natural if encapsulation occurs. However, if a person is unhhappy with the size, more often than not, they wish they were larger, until they get over about 50 years old.</p><p>Then they wish they werre smaller. Good luck with picking the proper size and the procedure. Personally, I strive to have the result look as natural as possible regardless of the procedure. (E. Ronald Finger, MD, Savannah Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>What is the right size breast implant for me?</h3><p>Choosing the right implant size: What is your chest size?</p><ol>
<li>32 a/b to a 32 c only requires about 275 to 300 cc of volume.</li>
<li>32 requires less volume than 34,</li>
<li>34 needs less than 36</li>
<li>Moderate or standard implants are wider than Plus</li>
<li>Plus are wider than High profile</li>
<li>Saline implants can be adjusted somewhat</li>
</ol><p>It is important to consider what you consider is an attractive shape and size of a breast and to be less concerned about the numbers. Pictures of women in and out of clothing helps some patients (Jed H. Horowitz, MD, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Unfortunately cup sizes are not adequately standardized in the clothing industry which makes it exceedingly difficult for us to recommend a specific volume.</p><p>Therefore the best method involves a dialogue between you and the surgeon using sizers to predict your final result and guide the choice of implant.</p><p>Given your preferences, the surgeon will provide feedback and recommendations. (Otto Joseph Placik, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It is vitally important to consider what you want. Your question seems to be asking if a C is the right <strong>most common breast implant size</strong> for you. An experienced breast surgeon should be able to show you pictures of women who are similar height and weight and with different sized implants.</p><p>This is vitally important for you to review in order to decide what it is that you are looking for. While you can always have your surgeon use breast/chest wall measurements to get the “best” most common breast implant size for your body, once you have that information it is always easy to go slightly bigger or smaller. (Evan Sorokin, MD, Cherry Hill Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Choosing the <em>most common breast implant size</em>, for an augmentation, is the most important decision to be made after deciding to proceed with the surgery! You should have a good idea about what size range you would like to be prior to your visit with a board certified plastic surgeon. You should have an extensive discussion about size during your consultation and then suggestions should be made about ranges of implants for you.</p><p>There are many ways to assist you in determining which implant may be best suited to you, and hopefully, your surgeon will provide these for you. Thus will assist you in deciding the right implant for you. (Michael S. Beckenstein, MD, Birmingham Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cup size is relative to body habitus</h3><p>A full C cup size is fine on almost anybody. Cup size is relative to your body characteristics. Since you are very petite, the implant that you would require to increase from an A cup to a C cup would be different than the implant that a 5’7″ 130 pound woman would require to do the same.</p><p>The determination would be made in consultation with your board certified plastic surgeon, who would take measurements of your chest and ask you certain questions about what you wish to achieve with your surgery. Personally, on many of my patients, I use devices called breast sizers along with the chest measurements and patient wishes, during the operation to help determine the appropriate size implant. Breast sizers are one time use implant devices that can be filled after placement under the breast during the breast augmentation surgery to determine the appropriate sized permanent implant for the patient. (Kenneth R. Francis, MD, FACS, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>While outcomes for cosmetic breast surgery are largely subjective, the biodemonsional method of selecting implants and assessing tissues is the most well documented for minimizing complciations. Thin women will do better with small implants placed under the muscle in most instances. Forget cuo size when planning and look for the device that most suits your chest wall dimensions.</p><p>Manuevers to widen or lower your natural boundries to accomadate larger devices are directly related to many of the complications from breast augmentation surgery.
