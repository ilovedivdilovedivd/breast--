Most adults, in fact, have asymmetric breasts – it is just a question of degree.</p><p>They can be asymmetric with respect to their size, as well as the position of the nipple/areola.Hope this is informative! (Bryan Correa, MD, The Woodlands Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Breasts usually stop developing by the age of 18, but that doesn’t mean that they stop changing. Weight fluctuations have a significant effect on breast size and shape, as well as hormones and their changes throughout life.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2322" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-f19c4ee415e49d8539c46bef1e0699a5">

</div><p>Pregnancies can change the shape and sizes of the breasts, as well. That means that differently sized implants may be appropriate at various times in a woman’s life, depending on her goals and desires.</p><p>It is important to be evaluated by a board-certified plastic surgeon who understands the goals of the patient and can match them to a range of implants that will provide the desired results. (Louis C. Cutolo, Jr., MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In most cases, breast growth begins during puberty (in women, average puberty onset can occur anywhere between the ages of 8 and 13 and lasts approximately 2 years) and ends once your body settles into adulthood, somewhere around your early 20s. Even once your breasts have finished their initial growth during adolescence, there are many other changes that can happen during your lifetime that can further affect breast size and shape, like weight fluctuations, pregnancy, nursing and just growing older.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2321" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-275cf58f9769c320c1726899187dc7d3">

</div><p>Implants can be considered after the age of 18, but some women choose to wait a couple more years to give their bodies a chance to catch up and others put breast augmentation off until after completing their families. (Nirav Savalia, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>As with many things related to the body, there are few absolutes when it comes to breast growth. Typically, the breasts stop growing after puberty ends, which can vary but often occurs between the ages of 15 and 18. Of course, just because puberty is over doesn’t mean the breasts will never change again.</p><p>Weight gain or loss, hormonal fluctuations, and pregnancy can all affect the size and the shape of the breasts over the course of a woman’s life. So although the breasts may stop growing, they continue changing throughout a lifetime. (Shim Ching, MD, Honolulu Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>At What Age Do Your Breast Stop Developing?</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2320" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Approximately between the ages 16-21 – when puberty ends. Although, there are cases of significant increase in breast size in a mid 20s or later. There does not appear to be a clearly identifiable time when breast growth absolutely stops. Generally speaking, by the time a woman is 21yo – she can count on that being her final size. (Thomas Trevisani, Sr., MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast growth and age</h3><p>No one knows for sure. We think breasts stop growing (developing) between 16 and 20 with the commonly held assumption that if they haven’t changed for an extended period of time (1-2 years and bra size is the same), then growth is complete.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2319" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Of course, they change with other factors- weight gain, weight loss, pregnancy, hormones etc. (Matthew H. Conrad, MD, Wichita Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast growth and development</h3><p>Breast growth and development varies markedly from patient to patient but typically reaches full maturity between the ages of 16 to 20 years. It is important to consider, however, that breasts will continue to undergo size and shape changes throughout life due to weight fluctuation, the impact of pregnancies, hormonal changes, and aging. (Scott D. Holley, MD, FACS, Portage Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Normally women stop beast development between 16 and 18 y.o. but they have changes in size and consistency in pregnancy, and throughout life. (Pedro A. Cota, MD, Mexico Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Breast development is unique to each girl/woman and like many things influenced by genetics and environment.</p><p>Breast development is one of the female secondary sex characteristics that are a manifestation of increased estrogen and so breast development proceeds along with other secondary sex characteristics (body hair, fat distribution, hip/pelvis changes, etc).</p><p>For most American girls and young women breast development is complete by the late teens.</p><p>If one’s breasts have be stable for several months and the other secondary sex characteristics are mature then it is reasonable to assume that breast development is complete. (Michael B. Tantillo, MD, Boston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Breast development generally stops at the end of your twenties. However, influences like pregnancy, birth control, weight gain and steroids can all drastically effect the breast size. (Marshall T. Partington, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>At What Age Do Breasts Stop Developing?</h3><p>The age at which breasts stop developing depends primarily on genetics, but may be impacted by environmental influences. The vast majority of women finish breast development around age 18, although according to reports, some may develop into their early 20s. If breast growth has plateaued for a year, it’s unlikely that the breasts will continue to develop after that. However, breast size can increase throughout a woman’s life due to weight gain or hormonal influences, including birth control pills, pregnancy, and breast feeding.</p><p>Breasts can also lose volume after pregnancy, after weaning one’s baby, and from weight loss. Breasts change throughout a woman’s life. Some hope for an increase in size throughout their teens and into their 20s, and they never get it. (That’s when they seek help from a plastic surgeon.) Click on the link below to see the case of a woman who said her bra size was “the flattest A cup” possible. (Heather J. Furnas, MD, Santa Rosa Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>When are breasts fully developed?</h3><p>It varies from person to person, but is complete by 18 or 19 in most people. Since it is individualized, you should wait to have any surgery until you feel like your breasts have been unchanged for at least 6 months. Good luck! (Dustin L. Reid, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Development and age</h3><p>Breasts undergo significant change during puberty in both men and women. After this stage of life your breasts will continue to develop and change due to pregnancy, menopause, weight gain or loss, medicines, and the normal aging process. At each stage there may be problems with development or unwanted changes. These issues can usually be addressed by a board certified plastic surgeon. If you have concerns make a consultation and get informed regarding your unique situation. (Andrew Goldberg, MD, Fairfax Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>As experts on the topic of women’s breasts, we can all attest that breasts never stop changing through life. At time goes by they can look very very different due to so many changes such as age, weight, and pregnancies.Let us know if you have any more questions and we can help you gain more insight. (Bernard Shuster, MD, Hollywood Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Usually by the age of 18-21, most women have finished developing their breasts. However, breasts will change shape and size throught life with hormonal changes and aging. I have seen women whose breasts grew substantially with pregnancy and never went back down to their prevoius size, though this is not common. (John Zannis, MD, New Bern Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It is important to note that your breasts will change throughout out your life secondary to weight changes, aging, hormonal variation (pregnancy, menopause).Typically, initial breast development is completed in puberty. Pubertal development will vary in both timing and extent from one individual to the next. this is both genetic and environmental. On average, breast development is usually complete by the early 20’s.</p><p>For any patient considering breast surgery, it is recommended that development have ceased (12 months stable) before considering operative intervention.As always, consult with a board certified plastic surgeon. (Donovan Rosas, MD, Nyack Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Your breasts are in stages of evolution throughout your life. When hormones like estrogen and progesterone fluctuate, your breasts can change composition from densely glandular to a fatty composition.</p><p>Gravity also stretches breast tissue and ligaments to a lower position on your body when standing.</p><p>Breast reduction, augmentation, and lifts are frequent procedures performed to help achieve ideal breasts for women depending on their preference and medical needs. (Jason Mussman, MD, Phoenix Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Your breasts will continue to change throughout your lifetime. The volume of your breast usually achieves its endpoint by 16 to 18 years old.</p><p>However, your development is also depending upon your weight gain and loss and your pregnancy history. As you get much older your hormone deficiencies cause your breasts to change in a way usually associated with atrophy and sagging.</p><p>Because of this, making choices for your breast enhancement is something that is best done with a board certified plastic surgeon. I can help you discuss your family history and your breast augmentation goals that you have at the time of your consultation. (Paul Vanek, MD)</p><p>Although breast growth varies from patient to patient, it generally stops between 18 and 22 years of age. Your breasts will continue to change throughout your life, pregnancy, nursing, weight gain, other hormonal changes, and aging will affect the size and shape of your breasts. (Arthur M. Cambeiro, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The truth is that breasts are continously changing organs. There are women who were A cups prior to having kids and are now D cups and vs versa. As for pubety related development, if you haven’t increased size by 17-18 then you are unlikely to suddenly develop breasts. On the other hand if your breasts are still changing then there is no exact time they will stop. (Rady Rahban, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Breast development stops after puberty however will or can continue to change with age, pregnancy, and hormonal changes. (David L. Robbins, MD, FACS, West Des Moines Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Development and Age</h3><p>Breast development begins in adolescence and in puberty the ovaries begin to secrete estrogen, causing breast enlargement through both breast tissue growth and fat accumulation. The rate and timing and amount of breast growth varies greatly up through the fully mature breast. Most commonly breast development has slowed or neared completion by age 18 to 20, but the breast continues to change throughout life through the influences of time, pregnancy and nursing and weight changes.</p><p>For cosmetic breast surgery, a patient must be 18 years of age, and I recommend waiting until breast development has completed (size has remained unchanged for 6-12 months). Some women are candidates for breast symmetry procedures for very asymmetric breasts at an earlier age. If you have questions about breast development and breast surgery, seek out an experienced surgeon for a consultation.Hope this helps. (Nick Slenkovich, MD, Denver Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In most females, breast development stops about 18 to 22 years old.This being said, breast size and shape will continue to change based on pregnancy, lactation, hormones, weight gain, weight loss etc. (Christopher T. Maloney Jr., MD, Tucson Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>End of brest development</h3><p>The changes in the late teens is small, but in general, and in concordance wit FDA guidelines, the age is 22. (Julio Garcia, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Most girls breasts have stopped developing around 15-16 years of age, but a few women will continue to develop up to age 21.</p><p>Pregnancy, nursing, weight gain, other hormonal changes, and aging will affect the size and shape of your breasts. You might consider asking the older women in your family about when they stopped developing. Genetics do play a strong role in the size of your breasts. (Connie Hiers, MD, Cleveland Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Some women may have finished their musculoskeletal and breast growth by 12 years of age, and some may grow and develop into their 20s. Breast size and overall growth should remain unchanged for at least a year. (Kenneth B. Hughes, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Development Ending Point</h3><p>This number will depend on many factors; (i.e.; family history, hormone use, etc). Most will say somewhere between age 16 and 22. Again, it is very indivudual dependent. If you have questions about your breasts and what might be able to be done aesthetically, please seek out a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon. They should be able to assist you. (Jeffrey Roth, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>When Do Breasts Stop developing</h3><p>There is no simple answer to this question. If what you are asking is when the adolescent growth and development are over, that varies from individual to individual. It is safe to say that when the other growth and physical developments associated with adolescence are complete, there should be no further “development” of the breasts. That does not mean that the breasts do not change after this point. The breasts will continue to change throughout life in response to many factors including gravity (particularly larger breasts), pregnancies, and many others. (Eugene J. Sidoti, Jr., MD, Scarsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>What age do breasts stop developing</h3><p>Dear bebe1101,Breast development varies from individual to individual. Breast development typically stops developing after puberty ends between 16 until early 20’s. Breasts change throughout your life time with age, weight and pregnancies. (James C. Pietraszek, MD, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Your breasts will continue to change throughout your lifetime. The volume of your breast usually achieves its endpoint by 16 to 18 years old.</p><p>However, your development is also depending upon your weight gain and loss and your pregnancy history.</p><p>As you get much older your hormone deficiencies cause your breasts to change in a way usually associated with atrophy and sagging.</p><p>Because of this, making choices for your breast enhancement is something that is best done with a board certified plastic surgeon. I can help you discuss your family history and your breast augmentation goals that you have at the time of your consultation. (Paul Vanek, MD)</p><p>Most women have completed breast development by the age of 18. I feel comfortable operating on women for cosmetic and reconstruction (ex: restricted breast deformities) reasons when they turn 18 years old.Breasts continue to change over a woman’s lifetime. Weight gain/weight loss, skin elasticity, and hormonal changes all contribute to breasts shape and size. (Joseph W. Aguiar, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast development stages</h3><p>Breast development occurs in stages, and there is a lot of variety between women. Many girls start developing raised nipples and a breast bud around age 7-11. Increasing breast fullness and changes in shape continue on for many years – usually stabilizing around age 16-18. It is important to note that some women don’t stop developing until after 18 years of age – everyone is an individual.</p><p>Throughout life, breasts continue to go through size and shape changes from weight gain or loss, hormonal imbalances, pregnancy, lactation, and the aging process. (Michelle Spring, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Although breast growth varies from patient to patient, it generally stops between 16 and 20 years of age. Even though growth stops, the breast continues to undergo changes for the remainder of a women’s life. This is affected by weight gain, pregnancy, lactation and gravity. (Richard J. Bruneteau, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>At what age do breasts stop developing</h3><p>In most women, breasts have fully developed by age 18, but some women can continue to develop breasts into their early twenties. (Michael Law, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Normally, breast development begins somewhere between the age of 7 and 13. Most of the time, breast development has ended by age 18.There are certainly situations however, where breast development can continue after age 18. (John J. Edney, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Full breast development is generally achieved between the ages of 18-22 years old. However, it’s important to remember that breasts never stop changing. Pregnancy, breast feeding, fluctuations in weight and lifestyle all impact breast health over the course of time. (Peter J. Capizzi, MD, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>For most women, the breasts finish developing at around the same time that your body reaches physical maturity. Typically, this is around age 18, although some women may reach their adult growth much younger than that. Some women take longer, and may continue developing into their early 20s. Regardless of when you officially stop growing, remember that changes like pregnancy and weight fluctuation will continue to affect the size and shape of your breasts throughout the course of your lifetime. (Glenn M. Davis, MD, FACS, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The answer to this question depends on the person. Most peoples breasts are fully developed by the age of 18. Usually the breasts have developed fully by the age of 18. Breast size can change at any age with weight gain, pregnancy, and lactation.</p><p>Usually breast growth stops by the time a women reaches adult height and is no logner growing. This is roughly between 16-20. (Steven Wallach, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
