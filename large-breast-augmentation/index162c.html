</div><p>In other words, if you do not have some type of “breast lifting” performed you may end up with the breasts sitting too low on the chest wall/upper abdomen and you will be displeased with the end results.</p><p>I realize my advice is not necessarily what you want to hear but be very careful about heeding advice that sounds too good to be true. (Tom J. Pousti, MD, FACS, )</p><h3>Look will depend on procedure you choose</h3><p>If you decide to forego a lift you will likely have lower set breasts than the model photo you show. I doubt the implants could be placed submuscular either. To get the most natural look without a lift, the implants will need to be dual-plane (partially submuscular), or subglandular. Even if you do forego a lift at this point, there’s a good chance you will require one in the future as the weight of the implants will likely speed the sagging process.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5165" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Very often when trying to create a more lifted look from implants alone, larger implants are used.Unfortunately this can also accelerate the sagging process. Most likely for the look you show in the photograph, a vertical (lollipop) lift with an implant will be required. Without the lift, the breast will sit lower on the chest.</p><p>Another option to consider is to use implants (silicon gel dual plane or subglandular), and to use fat grafting to help improve the upper pole fullness of the breasts. I have found that combining implants with fat grafting in situations like yours, one can avoid excessively large implants which unfortunately speed the sagging process. (Jeffrey Hartog, MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast lift or just large breast augmentation?</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5169" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Without a careful examination I can only give some general advice, but your question is very, very common. I think that it is great that you have included a photograph of someone’s breasts who feel had a desirable outcome, whether or not it can actually be achieved. It will help your surgeon to better understand your goals and desires, as well as manage your expectations.</p><p>The photographs of your current breasts show that they are relatively empty and have become somewhat ptotic (saggy). The nipple position is key in determining whether or not you will need a lift. Your nipple appears to be just at or below your infra-mammary fold.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5166" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>If your expectation is that you will still have some excess tissue beneath your fold with “mature” appearing breasts, an augmentation alone may be enough for you. However, if your goal is to look more like the model in the attached photograph, it is likely that you will need a lift. Consult with a board-certified plastic surgeon and ask to look at a number of different patients’ pre/post-operative photographs with breasts similar to yours. This will likely help you to make the right decision. Remember that if you have a lift, there is no such thing as “undoing” the lift. The scars are there forever. However, if you simply place an implant and are unhappy, you can always have a lift at some time in the future. (Eric T. Emerson, MD, FACS, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Lift Breast Or Not With Implants</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5168" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>I agree with your choice of smooth round silicone implants placed beneath the muscle. Although it appears that you would benefit from a breast lift, you state that you are happy with your nipple location. You should proceed with the augmentation. You can always have a small vertical lift performed later if you wish. (John Whitt, MD (retired), Louisville Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Treatment for breast sagging</h3><p>I understand your desire to avoid a lift if possible. The augment is quicker and less expensive and scarring is not a big deal. However, given the positiion of your nipples, I do not think that an implant alone with produce the desired outcome. An implant would accentuate the position of the nipples and may not result in an aesthetically pleasing breast. (Robert L. Kraft, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Large breast augmentation together with breast lift</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5167" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>With or without a lift you will not look like the women in the photo whose look you are trying to achieve. When you had the extra breast volume it stretched the skin and nipple areola on both sides. After loss of the volume the extra skin did not go away although it may have shrunk a bit.</p><p>There is no way to assess how much extra skin you still have from just a photo because it is not an extreme amount and I cannot see any stretchmarks in the photo even when magnified. Extremes on either side of the spectrum are easy to see in a photo. Something in the middle is not so easy to assess from a photo. I suspect that if you do need a lift it will not be a major one.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5172" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>Although you are currently happy with the nipple position/shape that could change after implant placement and surgical planning has to account for that as well. I hope you realize that this format of posting questions and receiving answers lacks the face to face direct communication required for you to make an informed decision regarding your surgery. My response to your question/post does not represent formal medical advice or constitute a doctor patient relationship. You need to consult with i.e. personally see a board certified plastic surgeon in order to receive a formal evaluation and develop a doctor patient relationship. (Aaron Stone, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>You can get augmentation first with the understanding that you will lift later</h3><p>The difference between your breast and the desired look that you posted is the position of your breast mound which is lower and touching the chest wall. You can try implant first, but you will have breast tissue sagging off the implant.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5171" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>The two stage augmentation/lift which is safer may work for you. (Kamran Khoobehi, MD, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Large breast augmentation with or without a lift</h3><p>As you can see, experienced surgeons recognize in you the anatomical need for a lift for the best results with your augmentation. Sometimes, patients will keep moving from surgeon to surgeon until they hear what they “want” to hear even if it is not what they “need” to hear. That being said, you can always do the augmentation alone and see what you think. If after 4-6 months you are not happy with the shape (breast sitting too low off the bottom of the implant) you can then do the lift and at least you will know that you tried to get by without it but weren’t happy. There is no problem with doing this, just would be two surgeries. Of course this is not to be construed as medical advice without an in person exam. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Cherry Hill Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast augmentation vs. augmentation with a lift</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5174" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>Your question is the same question that I get asked by prospective breast augmentation patients in my NJ practice on a daily basis. The big question is, “do I need a lift?” When looking at the photographs that you sent you can see several things. First of all, the areolae are almost touching the base of breasts. This often indicates that a lift may be needed or they will remain low after a straight forward augmentation. The old fashioned “pencil test” while a crude measurement of the question does indeed often work.</p><p>If you place a pen or pencil under the breast is there enough skin hanging down to hold the pencil in place if you let go? From the photo you sent it appears that there is indeed some “hang” to the breast. I tell my patients that implants alone will give you a bigger version of what you start with. If there is some droopiness beforehand, except is slight cases, there will still be some afterwords. From the photograph of desired look that you sent, you would likely be disappointed. All of this being said, it is impossible to make a true recommendation without a real consultation, examination, and discussion of your goals.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5173" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Internet forums such as this are able to give you a comment or two and a suggestion but this can never be interpreted as medical advise. I would highly suggest meeting with a board certified plastic surgeon who can perform an appropriate examination. (Evan Sorokin, MD, Glasgow Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Differences are the key</h3><p>it looks like you have several differences between your current look and the look you desire. You have more skin than the desired look, so you need a skin reduction. You have larger nipple/areolas than the desired look, so you need to have an areolar reduction.</p><p>You have a more saggy breast than your desired look, so you will have to have the breast tissue uplifted. Lastly, you’re smaller than the desired look so you need an implant. I think you would need an augmentation-mastopexy to achieve your look, and even then I think the differences between your ideal and your current look are so different that you will probably not look exactly like the desired picture, but you will hopefully be happy enough with the results you get. I’m afraid I don’t think you could get the result with just implants alone. (Taimur Shoaib, MD, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
