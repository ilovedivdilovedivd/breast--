If you have received and incision around your areola and are unhappy with its appearance, there are multiple things you can do to improve this.</p><p>If the concern is that the incision is too thick or in the improper position a simple scar revision may do the trick.</p><p>Other modalities to change the quality of your scar include dermabrasion, laser, and chemical lotions to change the color or texture.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2475" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>To learn more about breast augmentation, see photos, and help you decide which one is best for you, please visit us at the link below. (Pat Pazmino, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Anytime an incision is made, a scar will form. However, there are several ways to minimize the appearance of scars. First, be sure to follow your surgeon’s instructions before and after surgery including quitting smoking and limiting physical activity.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2477" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Secondly, the breast augmentation technique performed by your surgeon will also impact how your scar will develop. I use an advanced method which puts less pressure on the incision site to leave patients with a thinner, less noticeable scar. And finally, after surgery be sure to use a silicone based scar gel and avoid the tanning bed. At my office we recommend BioCorneum for scar treatment. (Tarick K. Smaili, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The two types of incisions that I use for breast augmentation are around the areola and underneath the breast. Both types of scars require time to heal, usually a couple of months, but end up to be inconspicuous fine lines in the end that are often hardly noticeable. If your surgery was very recent, I would recommend time to allow your wounds to heal properly – you will be surprised how they improve.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2474" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>If you still have problematic scars more than 6 months after your procedure, I would recommend discussing your situation with your surgeon. Creams and ointments do not really do much except drain your wallet, though there may have been a problem with your scarring that your surgeon can help to resolve. (Adam David Lowenstein, MD, FACS, Santa Barbara Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Most scars tend to improve over time – at least a year. Sunscreen and topical scar creams may help you while you wait. If your scars are just along the lower half of the areola, then they could be easily revised with local anesthesia in the office. Scars that go around the entire areola may be more of a problem. Your surgeon can give you the best advice after seeing your scars. (Randy J. Buckspan, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2476" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Scar creams don’t work. If you will just leave your incisions alone, they almost always become nearly invisible over time (months). If you don’t want periareolar scars, have the surgeon place the implants through an alternative approach (axilla or inframmary crease). (Vincent N. Zubowicz, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Improving breast augmentation scars</h3><p>Areolar scars from breast augmentation should be hardly noticeable. In my practice I find that some of them are even hard to find when looking for them. If you only had a breast augmentation you should have fairly short scars on the lower border of your areolae.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2478" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>If you had a lift the scars can go all the way around. In either case you can choose to have a scar revision. This would involve removing the scars and closing the wounds again. In most cases this heals better.</p><p>However, the quality of the scar has more to do with your body’s healing capacity than the surgeon’s technique. If you heal poorly in general, you may end up with a bad scar after a revision as well. There are some laser treatments and some medications (injections mostly) that may help. (Adam Rubinstein, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Scarring after breast augmentation</h3><p>Most scars tend to improve over time, but there are things you can do to help minimize the appearance of your scars. Make sure to follow your surgeons instructions such as quitting smoking and applying sunscreen. This will dramatically help with the way your scars heal. Scar guard and silicone sheets can also be helpful in achieving a fine line for a scar. (Richard H. Fryer, MD, Salt Lake City Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Appearance of your areolar scars</h3><p>Scars are an interesting phenomenon in that we can close an incision the same way for two different patients and end up with two entirely different scars.</p><p>The long term appearance of a scar is generally seen at around 1-2 years and is the result of several factors:</p><ul>
<li>how the incision was closed</li>
<li>how the incision was treated during the early healing period</li>
<li>whether or not there was gross or low-grade infection</li>
<li>how you heal overall</li>
</ul><p>As such, there are a few things that we can control and there are several factors that we cannot. To achieve the best results with any scar, a layered closure is generally performed to evenly distribute wound tension.</p><p>From here, there are a number of ways that physicians will attempt to modulate the final appearance. In my practice, I believe in early taping of the scar beginning around the 4th week using standard MEDPORE tape.</p><p>The scars are taped at this point and the tape is then changed every week or so continuing for the next 3 months. In addition, I suggest that patients massage their scars after about 4 weeks. And if the scars are still noticeable and suboptimal at the 6th month mark, I have begun treating them with a series of fractionated CO2 laser treatments and have seen very nice results. (Gregory A. Buford, MD, FACS, Denver Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Areolar scarring  after breast augmentation</h3><p>Periareolar scars typically heal quite well after breast augmentation. However, if your scar appears dark or raised you should consult with your plastic surgeon and consider using a silicone gel or silicone tape which can help lighten and flatten the scar.</p><p>You should also avoid direct sunlight or tanning salons as the ultraviolet radiation can permanently darken the scars. Please consult with a board certified plastic surgeon prior to breast augmentation surgery. (William Bruno, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Correcting around the nipple (Periareolar) Breast Augmentation Scars</h3><p>Every full thickness skin injury results in a permanent scar. However, the final appearance of the scar depends on the skill of the surgeon, the orientation, the mount of pull on the scar, the manner in which it was closed and your ethnic background.</p><p>In general, the around the nipple (periareolar) scars are the most concealable, narrow and acceptable scars, in addition, to being reusable in the future for both implant exchanges, pocket alterations as well as breast lifting. If you are not happy with your scar, see your Plastic surgeon, in the vast number of cases he could transform it into a much more acceptable form. (Peter A. Aldea, MD, Memphis Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Implant Scarring</h3><p>The scars from a periareolar breast augmentation are typically quite acceptable.</p><p><strong>Scarring after breast augmentation</strong> take several months to mature, and during this time they may be red to pink, raised, and firm. Over time, the scars will lose color, becoming pale to whitish and usually soften. To hasten this process, you may massage of the scar (2-3 times per day for 2-3 minutes at a time) or try silicone sheeting products. Prior to any scar manipulation, be sure to see your surgeon to ensure that the scars have matured enough to allow for massage. Regardless of the technique you employ, time is your friend when it comes to the appearance of scars. (David Bogue, MD, Boca Raton Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Areola scars after breast augmentation can be improved by Fractionated CO2 laser, if the scars are pale sun exposure can improve the pigmentation of the scar. Finally a scar revision can help at this stage because in presence of large implant often there is stretching on the wound edges causing scar thickening or widening. Once the breast settles down the scar can be revised with minimal tension on the wound and can lead to better scar formation. (Sanjay Parashar, MD, Dubai Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Reducing Scarring After Breast Augmentation</h3><p>Areola scars after breast augmentation will naturally fade, soften and flatten over a period of a couple months (may take up to 18 months).</p><p>To speed the process: massage the scars, avoid direct sun exposure, wear sunscreen, and ask your surgeon about scar-fading creams/gels like Kelocoate, BioCorneum, or silicone sheeting.</p><p>If scars are too light or wide after a year you can consider camouflage medical tattooing. (Larry S. Nichter, MD, MS, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Options to improve scar healing</h3><p>Areola scars after breast augmentation should heal nicely, however, there are several things I recommend to my patients to help accelerate the process of scar healing and give the best result.</p><ol>
<li>Scar massage, back and forth in the direction of the scar using a lubricant such as Pure Vitamin E Oil, Aquaphor, etc starting 2-3 weeks after surgery, twice a day for the 1st three months.</li>
<li>Silicone patches for scars and</li>
<li>Avoid any direct sun exposure to a fresh scar for the first year after surgery. (Renato Saltz, MD, Salt Lake City Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ol><h3>Areolar scars for breast surgery</h3><p>There are a variety of incisions used and so the scars may vary depending on th eincision.</p><p>For circumareolar scars, experts disagree on the type of suturing technique to minimize these scars using materials such as prolene, gortex, polyester, wire, etc. In addition to technique, the individuals response to injury and genetic predisposition for scarring is another major factor. Other than this we advocate the use of paper tape therapy, silicone products, avoidance of sun exposure. (Otto Joseph Placik, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How to Reduce areola scars after breast augmentation</h3><p>I usually recommend the following to my patients: Massage the scars with a silicone-based gel/ointment. It is the act of massaging the scar that improves the scar appearance.</p><p>If your scar is red and reactive, you should apply enough firm pressure that the scar blanches when you massage it. Taping the scars with 3M paper tape will help get the scar to a thin pale scar faster. It doesn’t change the final appearance, but it will get the scar to it’s final appearance faster. Avoid direct sun exposure on your scars and use sunscreen.</p><p>Avoid Vitamin E for the first 6 weeks after your surgery. If your scars are red and reactive, you may want to consider IPL treatment. If your areola scars after breast augmentation are over a year old and mature, then I suggest you see your surgeon again and ask if there is anything they can do in terms of steroid injections or scar revision.  (Asif Pirani, MD, FRCS(C), Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Minimize your scars by avoiding exposure to sunlight, massaging scars, and using silicone sheets/stickies/gel.</p><p>If the scar starts to become raised or thick make an appointment to see your plastic surgeon – you might require a steroid injection. Scars take a year to mature.</p><p>If you’re a year out and still unhappy, consult with your plastic surgeon to discuss a scar revision. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Massaging the scars after the initial healing is very helpful in addition to applying Scar Gel to the wounds.</p><p>Some patients do well with silicone sheeting which is available in a variety of formulations. (Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Scarring is inevitable after any surgical procedure. When breast augmentation is performed, every effort is made to hide the scars where they won’t be noticeable.</p><p>Incisions are typically hidden in the armpit, beneath the fold of the breast and at the junction between the areola and the surrounding skin. Unfortunately, in rare cases, adverse scarring can occasionally occur. This is usually due to wound healing biology and is frequently seen in patients with darker pigmentations. It’s important to remember that wound healing continues for over a year after a surgical procedure. During this phase of wound healing, there are several maneuvers that can be performed to minimize scarring. These include mechanical massage, the use of silastic sheeting and topical agents such as mederma. Even when these methods are used, scarring may still be a problem. If scars have failed to improve after they have reached maturity, scar revision may be an option. If you’re concerned about scarring, you should consult with your plastic surgeon. Your surgeon will be able to recommend an appropriate course of action. (Richard J. Bruneteau, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>If you are considering breast augmentation, it is very important to select a plastic surgeon who has extensive training and experience with this procedure. A properly trained and experienced surgeon can help you decide which incision is best for you. If your procedure is performed through a periareolar incision, then you would likely have a very fine line scar after surgery. This will be dependent not only on the skill of the surgeon but also on your postoperative recovery. If you develop any type of wound infection in the area or suffer any type of unwanted trauma to the breast the incision may widen. If your postoperative course is unimpeded, you should expect a very fine line scar in this area. In summary, the best thing you can do is to select the proper surgeon and follow all of the postoperative instructions. (John J. Edney, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>First realize that scars always get better in time, sometimes up to two years. I also recommend silicone gel sheeting. (Christopher J. Davidson, MD, FACS, Boston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Reduce Areolar Scars</h3><p>Start with massaging your scars and using compressive gel sheets. It’s important to give the scars time to fade. Scars will fade significantly within a year, and that would be a good time to reevaluate. If you still have concerns at that time scar revision may be necessary. (Jeffrey W. Hall, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
