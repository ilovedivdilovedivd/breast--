Transaxillary breast augmentation is no exception.</p><p>There are risks and complications not only from the surgery and anesthesia but from the implants themselves. There are several good sources of information you can review to become better informed.</p><p>I like the websites www.breastimplantsafety.org and www.plasticsurgery.org. These websites are sponsored by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons and the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery.</p><p>You can also go to the implant manufacturer’s website www.Allergan.com.

</div><p>You should discuss any questions you may have after thoroughly reviewing the consent. Although all of the information you will review may seem overwhelming, in the hands of a well qualified board certified plastic surgeon, the risk of developing a complication is minimized. Breast implants surgery is a rewarding and gratifying procedure for both patient and surgeon. Make sure you are comfortable with your decision and surgeon prior to proceeding. (David A.

</div><p>Many of the items on the list occur often enough that you should be willing to accept the risks.

</div><p>If the risks are not something that you can accept, then perhaps the procedure is not right for you, however, keep in mind that the vast majority of women, even those that have had a complication, when asked, state that they would do it again in a heart beat! (Amy T. Bandy, DO, FACS, Newport Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Risks & Complications of Silicone Gel Implant Breast implants</h3><p>This is far too complex to answer comprehensively here. However, I provide my patients with the Mentor (now a J&J subsidiary) FDA approved 60 PAGE BROCHURE!</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2926" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The link to this PDF document is pasted below. This details the specific risk and provides concrete numbers for each of these complications. I would suggest reviewing this to provide comprehensive answers to your questions. (Otto Joseph Placik, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It’s great that you are giving this a lot of thought before just jumping into it. If you decide to go through an operation like breast implants, or any cosmetic procedure, it’s important to grasp not only the risks but the potential benefits. I agree with the other physicians who have commented, you should visit with a board certified plastic surgeon to try and get some of these questions answered.</p><p>In the end, no surgeon can offer you an operation free of any complications, but you must decide if the benefits are worth the potential risks. In most cases with cosmetic surgery, the risks of serious complications are fairly low. (Daniel Sherick, MD, Ann Arbor Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The operation that has NO complications has yet to be discovered. Every operation comes with a set of possible adverse events that we cannot foresee or prevent.</p><p>Just like you cannot get into your car every morning and get on the road with an iron clad assurance that nothing bad would happen, we cannot try and help our patients without taking a small chance of hurting them.</p><p>As regards Breast enlargement – you APPEAR to be missing THE major downside of having implants. Like the humans that produced them and the surgeons who place them – ALL implants have a finite life time.</p><p>Each implant (BOTH Saline or Silicone gel filled) will fail and leak eventually. That is NOT a 1 in a million but a 100% likelihood.</p><p>Implants can last from 1 day to over 20 years but eventually, like all man made materials, the shell weakens, breaks and the implants deflate.</p><p>This means that unless you are in your 80’s and your implants outlast you, you will need FURTHER surgery in the future to replace the implants. You should also consider that some implants may interfere with your ability to nurse as well as to have easy mammographic studies. Your breasts are asymmetrical – this may actually be made better or worse by breast implants. Your implants may become infected and have to be removed to allow the infection to heal. All of these complications fall into the low single % digit rates – BUT if they happen to you that would not matter.</p><p>After reading as much as you can consider that there are Millions of women in the US with Breast Implants who would NOT give them up. Ask yourself if having fuller breasts are worth a small risk? If they are not – Stop here. There is no point in torturing yourself further. If you think, as millions did and do that the operation is definitely work it – see a Plastic surgeon who is a member of The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (www.PlasticSurgery.org) and have the operation. To learn EVERYTHING you need to know about BREAST IMPLANTS and Transaxillary BREAST AUGMENTATION follow the comprehensive link below (Peter A. Aldea, MD, Memphis Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Risk / benefit ratio for breast enlargement</h3><p>It can be overwhelming to try and get a handle on all of the things one needs to know about breast enlargement, and the terminology used doesn’t help. For example, the term “rupture” sounds like some sort of explosion, and that just does not happen. A hole in the implant shell can develop with wear over time, and with a saline implant, the saline is absorbed and the breast deflates, while in a silicone implant nothing observable happens. In both cases, it is a harmless and silent event.</p><p>With silicone gel, it is important to know that it is a semi-solid, so it doesn’t go anywhere, and silicone gel is nontoxic. Changes in nipple sensation are related to the surgery, not the implants specifically. In general, the larger the implant, the higher the risk because the nerves are stretched more to make room for the implant. The possibility of re-operation for either a deflation, capsular contracture, or other reason depends on a number of factors. A very high percentage of patients are happy with their implants, and it is the most popular cosmetic surgery operation in the U.S. today. (Richard Baxter, MD, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The risks you list are for the implants, but the risks of surgery and anesthesia would also apply. For a comprehensive listing I would recommend you visit with a surgeon certified by The American Board of Plastic Surgery for a consultation- listing risks without putting them into appropriate perspective for your individual situation (and this is, in fact what you are asking for) would not be fair to you or your chosen surgeon.</p><p>Only someone with a thorough knowledge of your goals, your medical history, your exam, and the details of any surgery that might be planned would be able to responsibly give you this perspective. Having said that, breast enlargement is a procedure associated with one of the highest rates of patient satisfaction known- because the benefit to risk ratio is very favorable for the average healthy, properly motivated woman. For help understanding how best to choose a surgeo you like and can trust, please read my Real Self article on Chiising a Plastic Surgeon (part 2). (Armando Soto, MD, FACS, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast enlargement risks</h3><p>Your listing is great but your concerns are bordering on obsessive. Yes, there are complications following any surgery. But the risks are extremely low. I know if one of these events occurs for you than the percentages are useless. Maybe you need an in-person evaluation to discuss your issues concerning breast enlargement? (Darryl J. Blinski, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In spite of the risks, this is one of the most popular operations around. If you looked at the risks of driving, flying or living, you might not want to do them. If the risks were great, why are so many women having this operation, and why has the FDA said the operation is safe? Your physician may be able to give you more reassurance. (William B. Rosenblatt, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Surgeons that are members of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons often will give you a 10+ page document to discuss the risks and benefits with you. We often give this document to patients to act as a checklist for discussion with the office so patients feel like they have considered the major issues.</p><p>The best option is picking a very good surgeon who performs breast implant frequently (and well!). (Pramit Malhotra, MD, Ann Arbor Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Complications and breast implants</h3><p>Reviewing the possible complications of breast implants can be daunting. Certainly they exist and should be considered in consultation with your plastic surgeon.</p><p>Overall the risk of sertious complications is small but real and should be seriously considered. Wishing you all the best. (Talmage J. Raine, MD, Champaign Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You have researched the risks and I would advise you to discuss these, in detail, during your consultation with your board certified plastic surgeon. Most patient fears are alleviated during this appointment. Once you have discussed the risks and the benefits with your surgeon you will be empowered to make an informed decision on what is best for you. (Christine Sullivan, MD, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast implant risks</h3><p>I hear your concern. Although breast implant is safe, simple surgery, when we think of “going under the knife,” we tend to worry a lot. It is normal human nature. You do have comprehensive list of breast implant risks. Breast implant can be done safely when done by experience plastic surgeons.</p><p>Breast implant risks of OR and anesthesia should be minimal on healthy patients. However, you do have to remember that implant is a safe medical device; it does NOT cause cancer or medical illness. However, it is still a device. It can deflate, develop capsular contracture, or have rippling. Please share your concerns /questions with your plastic surgeon during your consultation. (Sugene Kim, MD, FACS, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Complications of breast implant</h3><p>Although research of complications on the internet can be useful, an experienced plastic surgeon should take the time to review how relevant the complications you are discovering actually are, I would encourage you to arrange a consultation by a board certified plastic surgeon to explore the issues. (Terrence Murphy, MD, Englewood Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Assessing risks of breast implant</h3><p>As with any surgery it is important for the patient to understand the risks associated with having the procedure. Fortunately breast implant surgery is quite safe. There are literally millions of women with breast implants, some for over 40 years, most of them are quite satisfied. There is a wealth of knowledge available about risks of breast implants, as this issue has been studied thoroughly. As you well pointed out, one needs to categorized the risks as “one in ten” vs “one in a million”, you have to put things in perspective.</p><p>The most common complication of breast implant is capsular contracture, namely creation of excess scar tissue around implants causing aesthetic issues, hardening and possibly pain. Fortunately in our practice this happens quite infrequently, for a variety of reasons beyond the scope of this reply. The other complications are quite remote and are well explained and categorized in the booklet available from one of the two manufacturers that sell implants in the U.S. (Boris M. Ackerman, MD, Newport Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Risks of Breast implant</h3><p>You have a pretty comprehensive risks for breast implant surgery. With any surgery, there are risks associated with general anesthesia as well. The risks listed usually occur less than 5 percent of the time.</p><p>Patients should be aware that implants do fail over time and are not meant to last a lifetime. To learn more about breast implant visit our site below. (Ankit Desai, MD, Jacksonville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Those are all excellent questions and you should discuss them at your consultation. However, the risks of any of these complications is very, very low and if you really want the procedure, they should not prevent you from going through with it. Good luck. (Dustin L. Reid, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The risks of transaxillary breast augmentation and other cosmetic procedures are real and need to be fully understood.</p><p>But at the same time, they are relatively rare and should not prevent you from having the surgery if you really want to do so and are a good candidate.</p><p>Each of the listed issues (reoperations, capsular contracture, sensation changes, rupture, etc) are neither one in a million nor one in 10, but somewhere in between for each of the complications.</p><p>The complication rate does vary with surgeon technique and experience, so finding a board certified plastic surgeon is extremely important. (William T. Stoeckel, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It is important that you are knowledgeable and understand the risks associated with anything you do to your body, so I think it is fantastic that you have armed yourself and done the research! The list you have are definite concerns for breast augmentation surgery, but there are other risks that should be included such as: Infection, scarring, assymetry and unrealistic expectations, to name a few. Finding the right surgeon, board certified, etc, and asking the right questions should put your mind at ease in making this decision.</p><p>There are many factors that can be controlled in the surgical process to minimize the risks, which should make you feel more comfortable in your decision to have a breast augmentation. I would recommend that you consult with a couple surgeons and ask more questions to see if you feel more at ease with some of these risks. (Joseph Serota, MD, Aurora Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Worried about breast augmentation</h3><p>You should go to a reputable plastic surgeon and ask to see their consent form. This will list the potential complications in detail. Most of these are rare especially in the hands of an excellent and very experienced plastic surgeon with the properly selected and prepared patient. If you are too worried, don’t deny this and just do some more research and wait on surgery until you are comfortable enough to proceed. Nobody will guarantee anything, but the risks are pretty rare. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>A comprehensive consultation with a board certified plastic surgeon in your area should cover all of these. (Asif Pirani, MD, FRCS(C), Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Transaxillary Breast Augmentation Risks</h3><p>The newer silicone implants are from a more cohesive gel and are safe for insertion. However, with any device there are risks and side effects. The risks include changes in sensation of breasts or nipple/areola complexes, infection, asymmetry, and poor scars. (Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Although some complications, occur more frequently than others, when breast augmentation is performed in a fully accredited surgery center with board certified anesthesiologists by a competent board certified plastic surgeon who specializes in breast augmenation theses risks are extremely low. (Robert Heck, MD, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The list of risks you mentioned are relatively comprehensive. that being said, most of these risks are quite low. There are some things that will definitely happen, given enough time, such as need for replacement of implants.</p><p>Other things, like breast pain and change in nipple sensation are actually quite low. Silicone implants have been proven to be quite safe and i believe the risk of capsular contracture is lower with the new silicone implants than with the old ones. (Eric Chang, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Risk of Transaxillary Breast Augmentation</h3><p>I think the list you have is the more common issues that can arise, but a comprehensive list would be larger and can be detailed in a pre-operative consultation. One can calculate that the need or desire for a repeat surgery after a transaxillary breast augmentation is about 20-24% during your lifetime. The most common reasons for the second surgery would be capsular contracture, rupture of the implant, sagging or implant position change. Implant rupture rates are about 1% per year, capsular contracture rates can vary from 5-25%, depending on whether the implant is placed above or below the muscle.</p><p>Not all patients with capsular contracture desire or need surgery though as there are different degrees of the contracture or degree of firmness.
