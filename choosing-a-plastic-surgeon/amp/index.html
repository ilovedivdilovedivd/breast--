</div><p>I am sure there are many surgeons who perform breast augmentation in your area, but you really want to find someone with an artistic eye, a great track record of success, and the willingness to listen to what you want. Do not settle for someone you think will do a good job and certainly do not choose based on price. You will get what you pay for. (David Bogue, MD, Boca Raton Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How to find the Best Cosmetic Surgeon</h3><p>When looking for a best surgeons for breast augmentation one of the best initial resources is the American Society of Plastic Surgery , www.plasticsurgery.org. These are surgeons who are Board Certified ( fully trained & tested ) in the field Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery. Cosmetic surgery training is achieved through a residency in Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_976" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>This is very important because many “Cosmetic ” Surgeons are not trained formally, they have taken a weekend course to get a “cosmetic” certificate or are completely self taught and some will have certificates that state “Cosmetic.etc” that look very authentic but do equate to proper training as is required to have the credibility of Board Certification. The American Society of Plastic Surgery can provide a list of Board Certified Plastic Surgeons in your area and they also have web sites for many of the Board Cerfified Plastic Surgeons with links to the personal web site.</p><p>You do not have to choose between good and nice. Many Plastic Surgeons are both excellent surgeons and have wonderful bedside manner. Look at before & after photos and be sure you like the results. I highly recommend you speak with patient’s who have gone to that doctor as well. Do not be afraid to get a second opinion.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_977" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Try to become very educated in all the options for this procedure. This surgery, in particular , has many options to consider which will affect the end result, such as incision placement: periareolar, inframammary, transaxillary. Remember, once a scar is made there is no way to ever get rid of it. Another example of the many choices to make with this surgery is implant type & style: round, contoured, high, low or intermediate profile, textured, smooth. All of these options must be considered and taylored to your body tissue. Lastly, does the doctor listen to what you want and are they going to get you the results you want, or are they trying to talk you into what they want. Be very careful about this. Some doctors feel that they are better at making the size decision than you, or don’t take into consideration what you want, or feel that you can not be as big as you think you would like to be. There are many ways to skin a cat, so find a doctor who understands your needs and listens to you, educates you on your options, has results you find to be attractive and patient’s who love them. (David Bogue, MD, Boca Raton Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Best Breast Augmentation</h3><p>The key element to finding the best breast augmentation surgeon is to do your homework.</p><p>Visit several Board Certified Plastic Surgeons that specialize in this area of breast augmentation.</p><p>Study their pre and post op photos on their website.</p><p>Visit and consult with several Board Certified Plastic Surgeons to make sure that you receive a comprehensive evaluation including about the procedure itself, the risks, as well as the options of saline versus silicone implants, and the incision placement.</p><p>One must get a sense of the surgeon’s integrity and honesty.</p><p>Remember that implants do not last forever, they normally last 10-15 years, so they will require replacement at that time. (John K. Wakelin III, MD, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How To Find the Best Plastic Surgeon For You</h3><p>This is a very common question that I get from people, and one that doesn’t have an exact answer. What you need to know is that Breast Augmentation surgery is really not all that difficult. In fact, most well trained Plastic Surgeons in the United States can perform this surgery very well, with amazing post operative results. What is very important however, is the following:</p><ol>
<li>Make sure your surgeon is a Diplomate of the American Board of Plastic Surgery</li>
<li>Ask the surgeon if he/she performs a significant amount of these procedures on a regular basis</li>
<li>Ask for pre and post operative pictures of women with similar body types to yours</li>
<li>Go to several surgeons to decide which one you like best.</li>
<li>And most important, you have to feel very comfortable with the surgeon you choose (Remus Repta, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ol><h3>Finding a plastic surgeon</h3><p>The best way to find a plastic surgeon is to go to the website of the American Society of Plastic surgery: Plasticsurgery.org. They have a physician locator tool on their website. Also check with friends through word of mouth and visit with several American Board of Plastic Surgery certified plastic surgeons. (Remus Repta, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Board certified plastic surgeons recommended</h3><p>I would recommend that you seek a board certified plastic surgeon for your breast augmentation surgery. You can consult the American Society of Plastic Surgeons website for a board certified plastic surgeon that would be closest to you. I recommend a consultation with two or three surgeons and then pick the one that you would be most comfortable with, not necessarily the cheapest. You might enquire about where they did their training in plastic surgery, or what medical school they attended.</p><p>If you have had friends who have had the surgery and don’t mind sharing the information with you, ask them whether they would recommend their surgeon. You might ask the surgeon how many breast augmentation surgeries he/she has done. </p><p>Not necessarily the more the better, but I would suggest a minimum of twenty would qualify one as being fairly experienced in the surgery. You might ask what complications he/she has had and how the complications were treated. (Douglas Hendricks, MD, Newport Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How to find the best breast augmenatation surgeon</h3><p>Finding the best breast augmentation surgeon for your breast implant surgery: The best breast augmentation surgeon is the one that gives you the results you desire, given the limitations of your anatomy.</p><p>This seems obvious, but all too often, surgeons try to convince patients to do the procedure that they perform, rather than helping them choose the procedure that will come closest to giving them the result they desire. Research, go to several consults, look at the surgeon’s results on breasts that look like yours to begin with, and then choose the surgeon you feel most comfortable with. </p><p>At Hankins and Sohn Plastic Surgery Associates, we perform over 500 breast augmentations a year and the number one goal we have is to listen to your desires and help you come as close as you can to achieving them! (Douglas Hendricks, MD, Newport Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Choosing a qualified breast augmentation plastic surgeon</h3><p>Make sure your sugeon is certified by the American Board of Plastic Sugery.</p><p>That way, the surgeon has completed a formal plastic surgical residency and passed a detailed set of written and oral examinations.</p><p>Be sure to explicity ask that they are board certified in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. (Vishnu Rumalla, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Finding the Best Breast Augmentation Surgeon</h3><p>Start with surgeons certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery. Next look at before and after results that you like to narrow your search.</p><p>Look at as many results of their own as you can. Finally, when you meet with the surgeon you’ll know. (Vishnu Rumalla, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast augmentation</h3><p>Board cerification by the america board of plastic surgery is most important. If this plastic surgeon is also a member of the american society of aesthetic plastic surgery it infers a practice dedicated to cosmetic surgery. (Sugene Kim, MD, FACS, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Best Plastic Surgeon for Breast Augmentation</h3><p>The best surgeon for breast augmentation is the surgeon that can understand your desires and explain the options you have to achieve them. The surgeon must be certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery which can be easily checked at the board’s website.</p><p>If you have a friend or relative that has had breast augmentation, she can explain her experience. During consultation you should feel comfortable with your surgeon and walk away with the believe that he/she understands what you desire. (Sugene Kim, MD, FACS, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Choosing a breast augmentation surgeon</h3><p>Choosing a surgeon for any procedure can be done the same way. You should start with looking for board certified plastic surgeons, certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery.</p><p>You can do that here: https://www.abplsurg.org. You can also look for surgeons through the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Every member must be board certified: https://www.plasticsurgery.org Another good place to look is the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. All members are boards certified and specialize in cosmetic procedures: https://www.surgery.org</p><p>Once you have a list of a few surgeons you can visit their websites and get a feel for their results and their style. From there you can make appointments to see the surgeons that you like. I would recommend visiting with at least three surgeons. When you find a surgeon that you can communicate well with, and one that you trust, you can proceed with your breast augmentation with confidence that you are in good and experienced hands. (Adam Rubinstein, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Finding the right breast augmentation doctor</h3><p>First, look at the doctor’s traing and credentials. Look for a plastic surgeon certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery. This ensures that they have completed at least 6 years of surgery training after medical school, completed a plastic surgery residency, and passed both written and oral examinations to earn their board certification. Next, it’s helpful to ask friends and acquaintences who they have used for breast augmentation and how satisfied they were with the doctor and outcome. During your consultation, ask about experience (years, nuber of cases, etc.) and ask to see some before and after photos. Finally, use the web to verify credentials (medical license, board certification, etc.). There’s many well qualified surgeons out there who can do this procedure well. Find one that you’re comfortable with. (Adam Rubinstein, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Best rated surgeon for Breast Augmentation</h3><p>First, make sure that the surgeon is a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon.</p><p>Unfortunately there are some doctors doing these operations that don’t have the proper training and experience. You should meet with your Plastic Surgeon and have a chance to get to know them.</p><p>This not only allows you to learn about the surgery he or she recommends for you, but also gives you confidence that he or she is a good match for you. It’s completely fair to ask your surgeon about their experience too, because this does matter. (Moneer Jaibaji, MD, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Do Your Research</h3><p>We all want to choose the best doctor to take care of us or our family, so do your research with phone calls and the Internet, do not rush into surgery blindly. Here are the questions you will need to ask the doctors: Are your Board Certified in Plastic Surgery? Do you have privileges to perform this procedure in the hospital and what hospitals do you have privileges at? Where is the surgery performed? How many Breast Augmentations do you perform annually? What is the total cost of the procedure? Can I see before and after photos of your patients? Have you ever been sued for a breast implant case, and what where the details of that case? Once you have narrowed your choices down to 2 or 3, then I would schedule a consultation to see if you “connect” with the surgeon, who wants on old grumpy doctor to be your surgeon? Make sure you ask other friends, nurses and doctors who they would recommend, you may be surprised on what you find out. The most popular doctor may be the one who can’t tie a knot during the operation.

<li>I would verify that they make an effort to understand what your goals are and explain the pros and cons of all of the different options (which they all have)</li>
<li>Review the best rated breast augmentation surgeons web reviews</li>
<li>Look at all of their before and after breast augmentation photos</li>
<li>and perhaps as to speak with one of their breast augmenation patients.</li>
</ul><p>Breast augmentation is not a difficult procedure so the importance is in communication between you and your plastic surgeon to make sure you are on the same page in terms of your goals and expectations. (Moneer Jaibaji, MD, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>One more VERY important hint..</h3><p>It is amazing how many doctors have chimed in here! Other than being a member of the American Board of Plastic Surgery and the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, there are two other things I did not see emphasized here. When you walk into the office is there a calming sense or is it chaotic ?</p><p>Are there papers everywhere or is there a sense of order? The atmosphere is a reflection of the Doctors work. If it is chaos in the office it may also be chaos in the operating room while your procedure is done. Do you want that ? I think not. Secondly Look closely at your Doctors web site.</p><p>Are the photos great quality, the same size in the before as in the after ? Are you wanting a modest augmentation but all of the before and afters are really out there ? It is important to be in tune with the Doctors concept of “large” so that it means the same thing that your “Large ” does. (John K. Wakelin III, MD, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>No “best” in augmentation surgeons</h3><p>There is no best surgeon when it comes to augmentation as it is a very common procedure.</p><p>As the prior posters have elaborated, talk to patients, see the doctors, evaluate their policies, and choose the one that best fits you and can deliver on your expectations.</p><p>All doctors like to think they are the best but the being the best requires the whole package and not just the procedure itself. (Curtis Wong, MD, Redding Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How Do I Find the Best Breast Augmentation Surgeon?</h3><p>There are several ways you can refine your search: first, make sure your potential surgeon is board certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery.</p><p>Second, look at their before and after results, a busy surgeon should have dozens if not hundreds of pictures of their own patients for you to review – make sure you like the results that they have.</p><p>Next, force yourself to visit at least 2 or 3 different plastic surgeons who already meet the above criteria. </p><p>Each surgeon will have a different philosophy, and personality, and you want to select the one that matches you best. Take your time! (Curtis Wong, MD, Redding Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Start with a board certified plastic surgeon</h3><p>Board certified plastic surgeons train a minimum of 5 yrs to learn the art and science of plastic surgery. look for one in your area. the american society of plastic surgeons website is a good place to start. plasticsurgery.org. (Matthew Concannon, MD, Columbia Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Several things to consider</h3><p>First of all you want to make sure that your surgeon is a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon in good standing. Consider seeing a few different surgeons for a consultation. Make sure that you have a good understanding of the surgeon and his practice and that what you are seeking can be achieved.</p><p>Always ask to see before and after photos and find out if your surgeon is willing to give you names and phone numbers of previous patients so you can speak one on one with a previous patient about their experience. If you prefer a natural looking result make sure your surgeon has the same aesthetic eye.</p><p>Do your homework. The more information you have in regards to the procedure you are interested in and the surgeon the easier it will be for you to make the right decision. (Matthew Concannon, MD, Columbia Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How do you find the best plastic surgeon?</h3><p>The best start is to find one certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgeons. This at least assures you that your surgeon has been properly trained. Then interview the surgeon to find out if his goals meet yours. This surgery is for you, not for your surgeon.</p><p>You are the one who has to live with the results. The next thing that I feel is important is whether you want to look natural. Lately, because of movie stars, magazines, etc. people think that breast should look like mounds and not a natural breast.</p><p>A breast augmentation is much more complex than simply stuffing an implant into a pocket. Ask what are the measures taken to minimize “encapsulation,” which is hardening of the breast. Discuss the various incisions with the pros and cons. Ask the advantages of the saline vs. silicone implants and whether it should go under or on top of the muscle.</p><p>Ask about the recoverty time. Get a second opinion if you are unhappy with the answers you get. These won’t assure you the best plastic surgeon (there may not be a best), but it will put you on the right path toward a satisfactory result for years to come. (Eric Chang, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Best Breast Augmentation Surgeon for Best Cosmetic Result</h3><p>When choosing the best augmention surgeon it is important to find a plastic surgeon who is board certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery.</p><p>If you have a friend or friends who have had breast augmentation surgery ask their recommendation for a plastic surgeon who does cosmetic surgery.</p><p>It is also a good idea to get a recommendation from your primary care physician.</p><p>Visit the board certified plastic surgeon ask to see before and after photos of their work and to get a sense of their aesthetic judgement.</p><p>Also, make sure you like the surgeon as you will be working closely with the surgeon over the next month and you need the surgeon to understand your preferences. Decide on breast size prior to the surgery and discuss this with the surgeon always considering their professional advice. If you are unhappy with a cosmentic surgery consultation visit 2-3 board certified plastic surgeons. (Eric Chang, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Best surgeon for breast augmentation</h3><p>A few things to consider when searching for a plastic surgeon:</p><ol>
<li>Make sure they are a Board Certified Plastic Surgery (not a “cosmetic” surgeon.) It is important to know that your doctor was trained specifically for Plastic surgery, not a doctor that specializes in ear,nose and throat, doing breast augmentations.</li>
<li>Patient reviews and recommendations. It is always good to hear and read about past experiences.</li>
<li>Doctor/patient relationship. Do you feel comfortable with them? Were all your questions answered?</li>
<li>Make an informed decision that you are comfortable with, don’t be talked into something you don’t really want. (Renato Saltz, MD, Salt Lake City Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ol><h3>The best breast implant surgeon for breast augmentation</h3><p>Besides having the qualification of being board-certified in plastic surgery, ultimately the best surgeon for you is the one that you connect with, one that takes the time to answer all your questions, and one that can show you good results.</p><p>I would be careful of choosing a surgeon based on prices or “specials.” Although discounts and specials are found in most plastic surgery practices, it is generally regarded as unethical by the American Society of Plastic Surgery to provide these discounts for surgery. Trust your instincts and ask any questions that are important to you. (Renato Saltz, MD, Salt Lake City Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Finding your surgeon for breast augmentation</h3><p>Whenever you choose a physician to care for your problem it makes sense to make sure he has the background, training and experience to provide your specific care. Make sure the surgeon is Board Certification by the American Board of Plastic Surgeons and a part of the American Board of Medical Specialties shows the Plastic Surgeon has met those standards. Physicians upon finishing medical school receive their medical license or MD degree. In many states after one year of residency a Physician can legally practice medicine or surgery. </p><p>While medical licensure sets the minimum competency requirements to diagnose and treat, it is not specialty specific. Medical specialty certification is a voluntary process. The American Board of Medical Specialties is the pre-eminent entity (often considered the Gold Standard) overseeing the certification physician specialists in the United States. </p><p>Simply put would you knowingly get on a plane and fly with a pilot who failed the FAA exam for pilots and is not certified? Would you knowingly have surgery by a physician claiming to be Board Certified rather than checking on their credentials. Most states Board of Medicine have web sites which can offer you this information or ask the physician personally. (E. Ronald Finger, MD, Savannah Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Best qualified surgeon for breast augmentation</h3><p>Choosing a qualified surgeon to perform your breast augmentation surgery is one of the most important decisions you can make. When checking the credentials of your surgeon, look for a surgeon who is board certified in plastic surgery thru the American Board of Plastic Surgery. Additionally, ask your surgeon if he or she is a member of ASPS, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, as well as ASAPS, the American Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. As a member of both of these societies, you can feel confident that your surgeon has met the strictest standards available in plastic surgery.</p><p>Additionally, when meeting with your prospective surgeon, ask how many breast augmentation surgeries are performed annually by that surgeon and ask to see before and after photos of patients that the surgeon has operated on. Family and friends are also a good source of information, many of whom may have heard about the surgeon or been a patient of the surgeon. Spending time researching your potential surgeon is an important aspect of surgical decision making and will be worth the effort, in the long run. (E. Ronald Finger, MD, Savannah Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
