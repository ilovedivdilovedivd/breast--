</div><p>Before surgery is conducted a conversation with the patient, during which the surgeon will explain all the possible problems and peculiarities of the technology, as well as will tell you how to behave before and after surgery. And, of course, answer all your questions. You can also choose the desired breast shape of possible, and the surgeon during surgery uses an implant, that will create the desired shape.</p><p><strong>Male breast augmentation</strong> is performed under general anesthesia. On each side of the body the surgeon makes a small incision near the armpit, and with the help of an endoscope creates a cavity between the major and minor pectoral muscles, normally ranging on each other and located in a special case of the connective tissue. Between these muscles, between these sheaths the implant is placed.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_6941" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

So we can say that the implant is inserted into the “natural sinus” of body without interfering with the blood flow, muscles movement, or any internal organs.</p><p>Breast implants for men are fixed in place with special seams – that they are do not shift.</p><p>Male breast enlargement takes 1-3 hours and ends with suturing incisions and applying a tight bandage around the entire chest.

</div><p>Male breast enhancement has long been held in the leading medical centers in the US. Such instructions are given by a doctor to patients – before and after it.</p><h3>Before surgery</h3><ol>
<li>Stop physical work for 1-2 weeks prior to breast enlargement. It is not necessary, but if you continue to work, the post-operative period will pass less smoothly.</li>
<li>The operation is performed under general anesthesia or a combination of local anesthesia with a special method of light general anesthesia. The choice of anesthesia method – depending on your wishes and the surgeon’s opinion. Narcotic effect fully goes in a half hours after the operation.</li>
<li>Come on time or pre-warn the surgeon about the possible lateness or refusal from the surgery.</li>

</div>
<li>Stop smoking and alcohol intake for several weeks prior to surgery. It is especially important to stop smoking: If during pre-operative examination, the doctor will hear expressed wheezing in the lung, the surgeon can cancel the operation because of the risk of pneumonia.</li>
<li>Do not take aspirin, ibuprofen, vitamin E, or dietary supplements with seaweed at least 2 weeks prior to surgery. These drugs thin the blood and may cause bleeding during surgery or hematoma after it.<br>
During the preoperative consultation tell your doctor about the medicines that you take continuously and follow its instructions on changing the time and the order of their intake.</li>
<li>If you have a tendency to bleeding, be sure to tell your doctor about it on preoperative consultation – he will appoint drugs to prevent bleeding.</li>
<li>Perhaps, before the breast augmentation, you will need to pass some tests, including blood tests.</li>

</div>
<li>Do not eat or drink after midnight the day of breast enhancement.</li>
<li>Within 3-4 weeks before surgery, take a daily vitamin C – it will speed up the healing of surgical wounds.<br>
If you catch a cold, feel an increase in temperature or a cough for a few days before the operation – immediately contact a doctor! It is impossible to carry out the operation during a cold, you will have to wait until complete recovery.</li>
<li>Do not bring expensive things in the clinic – they will not be required.</li>
</ol><h3>After surgery:</h3><ol>
<li>Warning. The effect of anesthesia will take approximately one and a half hours after the surgery. Go home and observe bed rest during the day, getting up except in a toilet. Lie in bed in a semi-sitting position, having enclosed under a back of 2-3 large pillows.</li>

<li>It is highly desirable, that from the clinic you moved home accompanied by another person, the best by car. You are not allowed to drive a car yourself for a day after surgery!</li>
<li>If the doctor on the pre-operative consultation or after surgery told you to take any drugs – carry out his instructions.</li>
<li>After surgery, you will be bandaged. Do not remove it by yourself. The bandage will be removed by your doctor at your next visit to him.</li>
<li>Come to the doctor after 2-3 days after surgery. Afterwards you will have to visit the doctor for monitoring your status on a weekly basis for a month, then – on the 6th week, after 3 and 6 months and one year after surgery.</li>
<li>After surgery, put ice on the area of post-operative edema – it will help to disappear.</li>
<li>You can take a shower the day after surgery, but be careful not to soak the bandage.</li>
<li>The first time after the operation do not raise your hands above shoulder level!</li>
<li>Do not load the pectoral muscles within 6 weeks after surgery.</li>
<li>Do not expose the scars and surgery area to sunlight for 2-3 weeks in order to avoid burns. If you are going to sunbathe in the first 6 months after breast enlargement – use of burn relief cream.</li>
