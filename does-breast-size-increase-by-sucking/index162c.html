<div overflow></div></amp-ad><div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Any type of negative pressure, suction, sucking, or chronic pressing or pushing of the breast tissue could do a couple things: the constant trauma can cause temporary swelling (and short-term increase in size), and the stress on the skin can cause it to lose elasticity and become more lax and loose. Unfortunately, there is no easy way and safe way to increase the size of the breasts permanently without putting something into the tissue – either an implant or fat injections, or overall weight gain. (Michelle Spring, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Increasing size of breasts</h3><p>There is a device valled the Brava that can increase breasts size, but in some cases it can also distort breast shape and stretch skin.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4039" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-056b452d0be00971c3be6f3afc00ca18">

</div><p>Vhck for a highlyexperienced physician to helpmyou with your goals. (Michael Law, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Suction and Pressure for growth or increase in size.</h3><p>Unless you are nursing, then no manipulation will increase the size of the breasts for an extended period of time. The Brava system utilizes what some will describe as sucking and pressing that will modestly and temporarily increase the breast size to allow fat grafting to the breasts. Breast Augmentation with implants is generally a superior way to enhance the breasts over fat transfer. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>No, and any change you experience is temporary because engorged tissues generally return to their original state. (Jerome Edelstein, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4037" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Manipulating the breast in this way will not change its size. The only thing that this may accomplish is temporary swelling in the tissues. (Gary Lawton, MD, FACS, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>BRAVA System and Breast Enhancement</h3><p>I’m assuming that your reference to suction and pressing refers to the BRAVA system. This system applies continuous suction to the breast over a prolonged period of time. Studies have shown minimal changes in the breast size with this approach. Its greatest value may be in combination with autologous fat grafting for breast enhancement. (Richard J. Bruneteau, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4038" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>There are always patients who swear that a system like BRAVA has worked wonders for them, and just as many who say that it didn’t help at all. This isn’t enough of a change for the majority of women who want enlargement, even if the results were consistent among all women (which they aren’t). Implants remain the best option for women who want more a predictable outcome from a proven method.</p><p>BRAVA is for fat grafting breast augmentation only. This technique may be how we do most breast augmentations eventually, but right now it’s expensive, time consuming, and can only deliver small volume increases. (Jeremy Pyle, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Brava for breast</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4036" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The BRAVA device applied external expansion (sucking) to the breast to loosen the tissues. Fat is then injected to augment the breast volume and the BRAVA helps to increase the survivability of the fat. I would recommend visiting with a PS in your area familiar with the BRAVA device. (Mahlon Kerr, MD, FACS, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Changes in breast size without surgery</h3><p>Manual manipulation of the breast by any means has never been shown to cause a permanent change in size. While there are vacuum devices available to temporarily increase the breast size, this swelling recedes within a few days. (Earl E. Ferguson III, MD, FACS, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Enlarged breasts through sucking and pressing</h3><p>The Brava system is one with suction, much like the appearance of one of Madonna’s old bra photos.</p><p>This has been on study for some time and remains unapproved by the FDA.</p><p>I have investigated this and although it enlarges the breast the result is asymmetric. At times fat is injected after wearing this device for 6 weeks 8-10 hours/day.</p><p>Injecting fat is also a subject of controversy. The BRAVA remains a novel concept for both cosmetic and reconstructive breast surgeons.</p><p>In my opinion, the implant route is currently the safest, most predictable method at this time. My prediction that at some time the BRAVA system will become more advanced and be more predictable with less controversy. (Peter J. Capizzi, MD, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The use of suctioning devices such as the Brava system will produce breast enlargement.</p><p>This has been documented in medical literature however there is about a one cup size increase only with this massage. Other than that system, thats the only one that will work. (Mel T. Ortega, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Suction to Increase Breast Size</h3><p>There is a system called BRAVA that uses a large plastic cup to provide suction to the breasts. By itself, it can enlarge the breasts minimally and only for a short time. The problem is that you have to wear it for quite some time to get a relatively short-lived result. Some combine BRAVA with fat injection and can achieve about the equivalent of a 200-250cc implant augmentation.</p><p>Fat is liposuctioned from your body and injected into the breasts. Prior to the procedure, you have to wear the BRAVA device for an extended period of time to “stretch out” your breast skin and create space for the fat. Most plastic surgeons and patients find this relatively cumbersome and the augmentation results relatively small. (Parham Ganchi, PhD, MD, Wayne Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>BRAVA system breast augmentation?</h3><p>The BRAVA suction system can be used on its own, although I hear about it used primarily in combination with fat transfer augmentation. I don’t offer either of these options at my practice, because I don’t think the results will be satisfying for most women.</p><p>The majority of women who want breast implants want a big difference, and the suction-based system only adds around one-half to one cup size if you’re lucky. These results can vary dramatically from patient to patient.</p><p>If you want results you can absolutely count on and that are much more flexible (you’ll get to choose your size instead of not knowing how your results will really end up), go with implants instead. (Frank Campanile, MD, Denver Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Are you asking about BRAVA system ? That system is rather cumbersome, take a long time to create a sizeable increase and the increase goes away soon after you stop using it. In effect you spend a very long time ‘enlarging’ your breasts for a brief period of larger breasts before the fall back to the original size. In the mean time wearing large suction cups on your chest for weeks will keep you hiding at home (walking down the local mall with them on your chest is sure to get some (unwanted) attention LOL) (Martin Jugenburg, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Although there is some data otherwise, I am unaware of any universally accepted data accepting that sucking the breast increases its size. (Christopher J. Davidson, MD, FACS, Boston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>If you are referring to the BRAVA system, then it may help when used in combination with fat grafting. I doubt it would be very helpful on its own to improve breast volume in an aesthetically pleasing fashion. Best, (Asif Pirani, MD, FRCS(C), Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There are certain technologies that are designed to pull or expand the breast tissue and the most well known one is BRAVA. It is essentially a large suction contained that sucks the breast up. This has to be used every night for several months and only a modest (one cup or less) increase in cup size is accomplished and thie tends to go away after discontinuing its use. (Remus Repta, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>the brava system can increase your breast size about one half or maybe one cup size by sucking on your breasts. For most patients the increase in size is not enough to satisfy them. Patients greatly prefer the results they get from breast implants.</p><p>The size and shape are much more predictable and satisfying. 3D computer imaging can be used in my office to estimate size and shape. (Michael Horn, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
