However, they may not necessarily become rounder. (Babak Dadvand, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2871" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>In the tuberous breast the skin of the lower half of the breast remains attached to the chest wall & does not grow with the remainder of the breast during puberty.</p><p>The developing tissue in some cases may be forced into or herniate into the darker tissue surrounding the breast nipple (areola) &/or may be constricted at its base. The difference between this scenario & small breasts is that small breasts are symmetrically smaller with respect to the circumference & center of the breast. In your case there is some visible ring like constriction in the lower half of the breasts. So you have a less severe tuberous shape. It is unlikely that the general breast shape will change that much as you get older. There is nothing that needs to be done if it does not bother you. The most important thing to keep in mind is that if you ever decide to have breast implants the lower half of the breasts should be released at the time of implant placement to prevent double bubble formation.

</div><p>It appears that you have a mild tuberous breast deformity with constriction of the lower pole of the breast. This could be corrected by an incision around your areola to correct the areolar herniation, followed by release of the attachments of the lower half of your breast from the underlying chest wall.</p><p>Subpectoral breast augmentation could then be performed to add volume to the lower pole deficiency of your breast. (Paul S. Gill, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You have a mild version of a constricted breast as mannifested by your enlarged “:herniated” areola particularly on the left and tight lower pole skin. (Otto Joseph Placik, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2873" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-1286af50e5a945c2ec3467311d703b4d">

</div><p>From the photograph you’ve provided, it appears that you do have mildly tuberous breasts, with elements of lower pole constriction in association with areolar prolapse. They look relatively symmetric which is good. Should you desire to reduce the “puffiness” of the areola, this can be achieved under a local anesthetic with minimal downtime. (Glenn Vallecillos, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tuberous breasts can be treated</h3><p>It looks like you have some constriction of the lower pole of your breast and hence a minor degree of tuberosity. Wait till you are fully grown before you think of doing something. There are several good options depending on what your goals are at that time. (Michael Weinberg, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tubular Breasts</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2874" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>From your picture, it does appear that you have a degree of tuberosity to the breasts. It is mild, but there does appear to be some herniation of the breast tissue into the nipple areola complex.</p><p>At your age, your development should be done unless you started puberty very late, so I would not expect things to change very much on their own at this point. They still could, but the chances are small. (Christopher V. Pelletiere, MD, Barrington Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I would say they are a minor forom of tuberous breasts. They do look slightly tight inferiorly and the nipple-areolas are a bit protruding. (Steven Wallach, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>A tuberous breast (not tubular though many confuse the term) describes a breast that has a tight skin envelope and lacks a fold under the breast, and a nipple which is very prominent, almost a herniation or protrusion of the whole nipple areolar area with skin that is tight around the base.</p><p>The tuberous breast is small and often asymmetric. Your nipple may have some tendencies of a tuberous breast however your breast is fairly normal on the whole.</p><p>Breast shape is an infinite spectrum and there are grey areas. Your breast is likely to change as ;</p><p>You continue to mature and perhaps have children. (Peter E. Johnson, MD, Oak Brook Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Tuberous breasts are generally defined by the following: short distance from the nipple –&gt; infra-mammary fold dilated and/or “prominent” areola loss of rounding to the lower pole with obvious constriction</p><p>Given these, from the picture you provided it does look as if you have tuberous breasts. Whether or not they will soften over time is a little unpredictable but I would guess that they would not.</p><p>You are probably a bit young for breast surgery at this point and so I would wait a few years until you are at least 18 and then explore your options with a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon. (Gregory A. Buford, MD, FACS, )</p><h3>Treatment of areolar area in tuberous breasts</h3><p>Your breasts are slightly tuberous. If the areolar puffiness bothers you, it would be a relatively straightforward procedure to tighten the areolar area. This could typically be done under local anesthesia if you wished. (Brent Moelleken, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Are my Breasts Tubular?</h3><p>You have a minor variant of tuberous breast deformity. If you are happy than just leave them alone – no surgery! (Darryl J. Blinski, MD, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tuberous breasts or not?</h3><p>Along the spectrum of tuberous breast deformities, you would be very mild. There are a couple of things you have that hint at this such as puffy areolas and tight lower poles but one thing you have that is very fortunate is good symmetry. Often tuberous breasts are fairly asymmetrical and this creates more problems. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>From the photo you provided it appears that you do have a mild case of tuberous breasts. The issue is how much does it bother you? The issue with the tubular or tuberous breasts is that the lower aspect of the breast from nipple to breast crease is short (yours fits) and the nipple and areola are wide and allow the breasts to protrude through this area making them more prominent (you fit here as well, especially on the lower outer aspect of the breasts). Fortunately there is a correction for this if it bothers you to the degree that you want it fixed. IT involves releasing the lower aspect of the breast, adding an implant and tightening and reducing the size of the areola. This will permanently simulate the effect you get when your nipples are erect and the areola skin tightens. (Vincent P. Marin, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tubular breasts</h3><p>From your photo it is evident that you have tightening of the lower pole of the breast (it appears more straight than curved) and herniation or “poofing up” of an enlarged areola. So, yes, you do have tubular breasts, albeit a mild form which can be contoured with an augmentation and possibly with or without a peri-areolar mastopexy. (Ricardo Izquierdo, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You have very mild tuberous breasts right more than the left. I would definitely wait for several years to allow your breasts to mature properly. (John P. Stratis, MD, )</p><p>Like so many things in life, there can often be a “grey” area. Tuberous breasts can be a spectrum, from very mild cases to very significant cases.</p><p>In your situation, you likely have a mild degree of tuberous breasts. The lower part of the breast appears to be somewhat “tight” or constricted.</p><p>You do not appear to have much bulging of the breast tissue under the nipple and areola which is another common feature.</p><p>In any event, if you are unhappy with the shape of your breasts, a visit with a board certified plastic surgeon in your area can be helpful. You can go over the surgical options to give you a fuller profile. (Brian C. Reuben, MD, Salt Lake City Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It looks like you have a slightly tuberous shape. I would rec a nipple incision and release of some of the lower breast tissue and you should be able to get a nice result. (Mahlon Kerr, MD, FACS, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I don’t really consider your breasts to be tuberous. They have a very slight constricted (narrow) base but the general shape and configuration of the areola are normal. Obviously there may be some difference of opinion. (Ronald Schuster, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Mild tuberous deformity, where cohesive gel implants (possible w/ low profile) and surgical released of the tissues (rings) will give you a much better breast shape.</p><p>Takes time tough, to see the final result, because the breasts will respond eventually to the new volume and shape. In our community we do not have any restriction in the use of Silicone Implants and you are a good candidate . (Ricardo Vega, MD, Mexico Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It does look like you have some degree of tuberous breasts. Tuberous breasts refer to breasts that are narrow and often don’t have enough tissue in the lower, medial or central breast. There are many different degrees of this “deformity”, and it appears you have a mild to moderate manifestation. This can sometimes be corrected by tuberous breast augmentation with an implant alone, but often to get the optimal appearance, a lift is necessary as well. Your plastic surgeon can evaluate your situation and make an individualized recommendation for you. (Adam David Lowenstein, MD, FACS, Santa Barbara Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You do have a mild presentation of tuberous breasts. You should respond very well to tuberous breast augmentation to add volume and also shaping to the breasts.</p><p>Your plastic surgeon will probably also perform some internal shaping to the breasts when placing the implants.</p><p>Because of your age, you are limited in your implant choice though if you are near a plastic surgeon who is in the cohesive gel studies, you may qualify to use of the newer “gummy bear” implants which are not restricted by the FDA age limit of 22 or older. (Herluf G. Lund, Jr, MD, Saint Louis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>From the photos you appears to have very mild tuberous breasts. You have a narrow breast base, somewhat enlarged areolaes, high breast folds and lack of bottom breast fullness. Your breast shape and size can be enhanced with breast implants. (Stewart Wang, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tuberous Breast and Breast Augmentation</h3><p>You do seem to have a mild form of tuberous breasts. If you are interested in increasing the fullness of your breasts, you would benefit from a tuberous breast augmentation. (Arnold S. Breitbart, MD, FACS, Long Island Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
