</div><p>A careful examination will reveal what options need to be considered, but please believe that you can have a nice result from this type of surgery quite possibly. (Francis (Frank) William Rieger, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Asymmetry is quite common, and plastic surgeons deal with this regularly. I am not sure about what your objectives are. Since this is on an augmentation page, I assume the larger and more even breasts are the goal. An actual and specific recommendation will depend on findings during an examination, but it looks like implants and a breast lift will be suggested to give a nice improvement. You might need just a periareolar lift on the right, but likely more on the left to deal with the discrepancy in the amounts of skin present on the two breasts. The surgeon will decide whether to use different sized breast implants to get an even volume, or do a small reduction on the left side to accomplish the same. Your breasts are further apart than in some women, but certainly do not look abnormal. Try again, ignore the first experience. (Jourdan Gottlieb, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4094" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I have been doing breast reconstruction for 30 years, and I assure you, no one is hopeless. Your situation is difficult but certainly not impossible. I have seen much worse. You need a lift and implants. That surgery can be tricky, but not impossible. (Mark A. Schusterman, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Plastic surgery exists to help patients look and feel their best. Of course you are not hopeless. All women come in different sizes and shapes, so you aren’t alone. In my opinion, you will have a nice result with a breast lift and augmentation mammoplasty. Please make sure you’re going to see a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon. I have serious reservations that you saw a properly trained and boarded surgeon. (Jeffrey Hartog, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4093" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-05d5972330a5ce9da40cb071f12d1b9e">

</div><p>You are definitely not hopeless!! You do have some asymmetry, as does everyone. During a consult with a board certified plastic surgeon, you may find that he/she recommends two different sized breast implants and a full mastopexy to give you the best outcome. If silicone implants are used your doctor may bring something called “sizers” to surgery to determine which implant would give you better symmetry. (George John Alexander, MD, FACS, Vancouver Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>This is not an uncommon degree of asymmetry and improving your breast shape is very achievable by experienced Plastic Surgeons doing a lot of elective breast surgery. However, how the information is relayed is also important. It takes time and effort to educate you about the best solutions and it always requires a honest discussion about limitations and risks. Credentialing and surgical expertise is critical, but feeling well cared for necessitates clear communication and a surgical team that you can relate to. I agree that another consultation is your best next step and should give you more hope. (Mathew C. Mosher, MD, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>With a breast lift (mastopexy) your breast can be lifted, your nipple areolar complexes made smaller and symmetrical and the size of your breast made much closer in shape and size.</p><p>With breast implants your breast can be filled out and made fuller.</p><p>I believe with the implants your separation will be improved.</p><p>While there are always limits to what can be accomplished, I feel you can have a incredible improvement and a result you will be happy with.</p><p>You must however have realistic expectations but you a certainly not hopeless. (Carl W. ‘Rick’ Lentz III, MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>A very nice symmetrical result is achievable with largest breast augmentation and breast lift.</p><p>You are not an easy patient, and it is important that you get multiple consultations from board certified plastic surgeons and look at their portfolios. (Pablo Prichard, MD, Phoenix Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I would recommend Bilateral Augmentation / Mastopexies. Without measurements and examination it is difficult to provide more specific imformation. Get a second opinion with an experienced breast surgeon. (Todd B. Koch, MD, Buffalo Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You can achieve a very nice look that is pleasing to you, but it is more complicated than just an augment. I my practice, to get the proper volume as well as good symmetry we would do a bilateral periareolar lift to resize the areolae and get them properly positiioned, a small reduction of the larger breast, since similar size implants in similar size breasts always look better,and subpectoral augmentation with a dual plane technique.</p><p>Any surgeon who does a high volume of cosmetic breast surgery should be able to help you. You just didn’t get to that doctor on your first try. But please appreciate his honesty in telling you he wasn’t able to help. (Ronald V. DeMars, MD, Portland Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You can achieve a very nice result with largest breast augmentation and breast lift. Although there are certain characteristics of your breasts that requires more thought and work to achieve the ideal result it does not preclude you from achieving a significant improvement in size and shape with a breast augmentation and breast lift procedure. (Remus Repta, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You would benefit from a mastopexy ( breast lift), and largest breast augmentation. Consult with Board Certified Plastic Surgeons to discuss your expectations and concerns. (Robert E. Zaworski, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I have operated on hundreds of patients with breasts like yours. You simply need to see a plastic surgeon with a lot of experience in breast surgery. You need a bilateral breast lift combined with an augmentation on the right or if you prefer a reduction on the left depending on if you prefer larger or smaller breasts.</p><p>Go to my web site and look under breast lift there are a few examples of breast asymmetry correction. It is often necessary to do bilateral implants. Good luck to you. (Farhad Rafizadeh, MD, Morristown Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Augmentation with Mini Ultimate Breast Lift to correct cleavage</h3><p>You are a perfect candidate for a new technique called Largest breast augmentation with Mini Ultimate Breast Lift. This technique avoids the use of the vertical scar or boat anchor shaped incisions.</p><p>Using only a circumareola incision it is possible to place the implant, reshape your breast tissue to increase upper pole fullness, elevate them higher and more medial to increase cleavage. The best implants are silicone gel placed retro-pectoral since they look and feel more natural. These can increase your cup size as desired and the lift will solve your asymmetry problems. (Gary M. Horndeski, MD, Texas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast augmentation mammoplasty and anatomy.</h3><p>Asymmetry between a woman’s breasts is very common. Procedures done to improve the appearance of breasts rarely lead to perfect symmetry (some would argue never!). The goals of surgery are to identify realistic areas for improvement and to understand that not every wish can be fulfilled. Implants are great at evening out volume diffences, but are limited in decreasing the space between your breasts.</p><p>Improvement is common, but patients must have realistic goals or else they will be disappointed. See multiple plastic surgeons to get an idea of what is possible for you. (David Bogue, MD, Boca Raton Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
