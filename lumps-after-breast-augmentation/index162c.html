</div><p>masses statistically occur more often in the upper outer quadrant of the breast where the majority of breast tissue exists. (Otto Joseph Placik, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Any breast lump should be evaluated by your physician so please bring that up to your doctor’s attention right away to make sure there is nothing that requires biopsy or further evaluation. Having said that, we see many patients who are very thin and can feel the edge of their implant where it is not covered by muscle.</p><p>In our Santa Rosa, California office we do most breast augmentation in a partial submuscular position. That means that part of the implant is under the muscle and part is not, thus allowing the most natural positioning of the implant and still having some benefit from the submuscular placement.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4494" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-06a1a06cc8830174602f4e0e25999fef">

</div><p>The part not covered by muscle is the one where patients feel “a bubble” ir a ridge. This is sometimes in the outer upper portion of the breast near the armpit and sometimes inferiorly where muscle coverage is less. This is a normal “feel” for a saline implant and does not require treatment. I hope this information is helpful, but do bring the area of concern to your doctor’s attention to make sure it is evaluated. (Francisco Canales, MD, Santa Rosa Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The lump you ar feeling most likely the edge or fold of the implant. However, a cyst, persistent inflammation, scar tissue or an unknown mass cannot be excluded. I feel it is important to continue to perform monthly self breast examinations and seek a consultation with your plastic surgeon or primary care physician if you notice a change. Bottom line, if something does not look or feel right see you sureon for an evaluation. (David A. Robinson, MD, Munster Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4493" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-6aaa92a21cd6736f863e7ba688b56fd0">

</div><p>Anytime there is a question of how things look, feel, etc the one who will know best at the present time is the one who operated on you. He/she should be able to evaluate you and give the proper advice This sounds like it is part of the implant, as a “water bublle” does not sound like a tumor or cyst. it is best to be evaluated so the appropriate care/advice can be rendered. (Michael S. Beckenstein, MD, Birmingham Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>If you are thin or the implant is wide enough so that its edges sit outside your normal breast tissue perimeter, you may be able to feel the saline bag. This can feel like a fold, a sharp edge or even a point, or a bubble. Check with your surgeon. (Robin T.W. Yuan, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Saline breast implants inherently can be much easier felt, or occasionally seen when used in augmentation. The saline can ripple or in certain postions a slight fold can be felt much like a small bubble that you can displace with your fingers.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4492" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-2240a3b88f35be89b5b951ceaf8d3b67">

</div><p>The performance and appearance of a breast implant is affected by the placement whether it be under the muscle or just under the gland of the breast, and by the amount of the the natural breast tissue to cover and hide the implant. Most often we place a saline implant under the muscle, though still the lower edge and outside edge of the implant will be covered by breast tissue only and at this area the implant may be felt, or a ripple can occur.</p><p>If you are small or have had a very full augmentation the coverage may be thinner and the implant more easily felt. Despite the bubble you feel you still may enjoy a very pretty augmentation with your saline impants. As a note of caution any breast lumps should be evaluated by your doctor. (Peter E. Johnson, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You did not mention the thickness of your breast tissue or if the implant is above or below the muscle. Feeling the implant, especially a saline filled implant, is very common. The thinner the overlying soft tissue the more prevalent the problem.</p><p>I have found that matching the appropriate base diameter of the implant to your breast base diameter and creating an appropriately size implant pocket can be helpful in preventing this problem. In any event it is common. If severe then you may need to consider changing over to gel filled implants. (Jeffrey Zwiren, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Any new lumps or masses that are discovered after a breast augmentation should be inverstigated to make sure that they are not malignant.</p><p>This would start by your plastic surgeon and /or primary care doctor examining you and obtaining either a mammogram or other comparable radiographic study.</p><p>If there is still some doubt about what the mass is a stereotactic biopsy with a needle may be performed by a radiologist to obtain a small specimen sample. There is certainly the possibility that it can be related to the augmentation.</p><p>This would be shown during the mammogram or other radiographic study. (Remus Repta, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Lumps after breast augmentation can be many things – the implants themselves, fat necrosis, retained sutures, or a pathological process such as breast cancer.</p><p>First and foremost is to have the lump evaluated by your surgeon. Any lump should be considered suspicious until it has been properly worked up to rule out malignancy. You describe a lump which feels like a water bubble.</p><p>This sounds like your are feeling the saline implant. At 9 months, the scar tissue around the implant is mature and if it is thin enough, you may feel the implant. Sometimes this is “rippling” of the implant or a fold in the implant at an area of the breast which is thinner allowing palpation.</p><p>Unfortunately, without surgery there is not much you can do about this. I recommend you bring it to the attention of your plastic surgeon to have it fully evaluated. (David Bogue, MD, Boca Raton Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Lump after Breast Augmentation</h3><p>ANY breast mass should be taken seriously and be worked up promptly. From your description it may be the edge of the saline breast implant BUT that should be determined by your surgeon. Please, see him / her and have this determined. (Peter A. Aldea, MD, Memphis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Any new lump in the breast should be evaluated as soon as possible by a qualified physician. When a breast implant is present, the lump could represent a number of implant-specific issues, such as an implant edge, ripple, fold, or valve.</p><p>However, it might not be any of these things and may require more investigation. Make sure that you see your doctor as soon as possible to determine if further workup is appropriate. (Amy M. Sprole, MD, Wichita Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Lump post breast augmentation with saline implants</h3><p>Seek your surgeon immediately to evaluate this ‘lump” . It could be so many things. Even a mammogram might be in order. (Darryl J. Blinski, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Of course you should be thoroughly examined, but most likely this is nothing serious. Saline breast implants sometimes develop a “knuckle”, specially if they are underfilled. This feels like a lump, but is quite safe. (George J. Beraka, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I am glad you are doing a self exam – I encourage all my patients to examine their own breasts once per month. The current lifetime risk for breast cancer is about 1 out of 8 women, so all “lumps” should be taken seriously. I don’t want you to get too anxious about it, but certainly do not ignore it! Go visit with your plastic surgeon and get them to examine your breast, showing them the location of the lump.</p><p>It could just be the implant, but you do not want to make that assumption. (Michael A. Bogdan, MD, FACS, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Couple of reasons for breast augmentation lump</h3><p>Saline implants would have couple of reasons why you may feel a lump. Either you are feeling a fold and that would be more pronounced if the implant is placed above the muscle or you are very thin and without much breast tissue. Or you may be feeling the implant valve area if the lump you are feeling is in the center of your breast. Again these would be the result of the implant not having adequate coverage. However, no breast lump should be left alone without a full evaulation by your surgeon. I would recommend calling your surgeon as soon as possible to schedule a follow-up visit. (Bahram Ghaderi, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Lumps can be a normal feeling under your breast , especially after breast augmentation surgery using saline implants. These lumps usually are felt in the area by your breast fold. Feeling the implant in this area especially a saline implant is very common. You didn’t mention if the implant is above or below the muscle? Also, sometimes if you have very little breast tissue prior to surgery, the implant may be felt. But it could be a suspicious breast lump. Again, a quick visit back to your surgeon can answer these questions. (Gregory Turowski, MD, PhD, FACS, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Lumpiness that is felt along the inferior pole of the breast by the fold is often the implant itself. This is very common, but I would see your doctor if you are concerned. (Steven Wallach, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>As stated by the masses above, it is most likely your implant edge. Have your plastic surgeon evaluate it. Don’t forget, you should have at least annual follow up with your surgeon, as well as, your gynecologist for a breast exam. (Kenneth R. Francis, MD, FACS, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>If you are worried, follow up with your doctor</h3><p>Odds are it is nothing, you are just feeling a piece of the implant; however, you should set up an appointment to see your surgeon so he can check you out and reassure you. Without seeing you and feeling your breast, I cannot give you a diagnosis. (William B. Rosenblatt, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>This is a difficult question to answer without examining you and knowing some details about how your surgery was done, but it sounds like you are experiencing a bit of saline implant palpability, or the ability to feel the implant through your tissues. There are several causes of this problem, including thin skin and or tissues (the thicker your tissues, the better they will camouflage a saline implant) and a saline implant’s inherently higher risk of visibility or palpability. This is one of the most common reasons women with saline implants wish to switch to silicone, which has a much lower risk of this problem and feels more natural. I would make a visit to your board certified plastic surgeon for an exam and discussion of your options. (Armando Soto, MD, FACS, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Without examining you, it is impossible to say for sure what this is. Go back to your doctor and ask. Most likely, if it is in the lower pole or along the outer edge, you are just feeling the implant where the tissue over it is thinner. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Without an exam, I am speculating. You may be feeling the edge of the implant, a lymph node, a fibrocystic lesion or even something else. Most of the things that it could be are benign, and nothing to worry about. It is something you should have examined, for peace of mind. (Scott E. Kasden, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
