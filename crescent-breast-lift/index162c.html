</div><p>Otherwise it just gives you poor scars and a flattened shape to the breast. There is no question that you need the vertical scar and perhaps the inverted T lift in order to obtain a proper lift and reshaping of the breast over an implant.</p><p>Pardon my bluntness, but based on your photos, I would recommend you avoid any surgeon who tells you that a very minor periareolar lift, let alone a crescent breast lift, will give you a satisfactory result.</p><p>No patient wants additional scars that they don’t need, but the additional scars are, in the long run, less noticeable than an ugly shape.

</div><p>With your amount of loose skin and sag, a crescent lift will not correct your problem and you will then be faced with a second surgery and costs associated with that. I really think that you need a T-scar type lift, though you might be able to do a circumvertical lift.</p><p>This can really only be determined with an in person exam to assess your tissue. The bottom line is that trying to minimize scars is a good goal, but if it does not achieve a pleasing shape to your breast, you will not be happy. (Donald Griffin, MD, Nashville Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Vertical breast lift</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4129" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-e24e597143b25244ff1b1a78a26ec2eb">

</div><p>You need more then a crescent breast lift. The look you want picture shows a very augmented look with little natural breast tissue and there is alot of projection. The implants may also be subglandular.</p><p>I reccomend you interview several local board certified plastic surgeons who can show you their results.

</div><p>A crescent breast lift involves the removal of a crescent from the skin immediately above the nipple. It elevates or, more correctly, repositions the nipple higher on the breast. It is an extremely useful tool when the nipple position is low with respect of the breast mound and is often used in conjunction with a breast augmentation. In such a case, the implant may be introduced through the crescent incision.</p><p>The resulting scar runs around the top half of the areola at its junction with breast skin. It is only useful, however, when the elevation is small: 1-2 cms typically. Larger elevations would likely distort the nipple.</p><p>It is certainly not a ‘breast lift,’ and, after looking at your pictures, I have no hesitation in saying that it is a breast lift that you require. Check the reference. (J. Brian Boyd, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4132" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-f19c4ee415e49d8539c46bef1e0699a5">

</div><p>The amount of lift a patient will need depends on a number of factors to include how much laxity or sag that you have, the quality of your tissue (has it been stretched a lot or a little) and the size of the implant you chose to have. I agree with every other post that there is very little utility in the crescent lift for all of the reasons mentioned.</p><p>Based upon the pictures you have forwarded you will benefit from a lift that encompasses a scar around the areola, down the middle and probably in the fold of the breast as well. You would be best served by having consultation with one or more board-certified plastic surgeons and decide who you decide to take care of you. (Michael C. Edwards, MD, FACS, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast augmentation with a lift</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4133" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>It appears as though you can get an excellend result with a breast augmentation combined with a lift. The lift will most likely need to be around the areoala or the lollipop lift. This really depends upon the breast implant size that you choose. The bigger the implant, the less of a lift you will need because the implants themselves will give you little lift. A crescent breast lift might not be enough and the scarring can stretch out over time. (Jeffrey E. Schreiber, MD, FACS, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast lift options</h3><p>Hello, Thank you for the question and the photos. Let me first start by saying that if the breast augmentation is done properly, that is the breast fold is not released or lowered, you will have the option of a breast lift at the same time or in the future without any repercussions. The idea of doing a breast augmentation with the intent of providing a “breast lift” by lowering the breast fold is the only real bad decision.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4134" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>In your case I would opt for a “full” breast lift (lollipop type incision) for two reasons. One is that your breast itself (not just the areola) is below the fold. Second, your ideal breast result shows a “perky” breast shape and a smaller areola. Both of these characteristics require a breast lift an not a partial areolaplasty (crescent breast lift). (Remus Repta, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>A fuller lift is needed</h3><p>The “crescent” lift has limited ability to shape and lift the breast and can lead to an unsatisfactory areolar shape. Best would be at least a circumareolar lift and possible “lollipop” or vertical addition to more effectively lift and shape your breast. An examination is the best way to decide. (David J. Levens, MD, Coral Springs Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Because of the magnitude of the ptosis in the desire for a smaller areola a conventional mastopexy is a better choice. (Vincent N. Zubowicz, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Based on your goal photo, you certainly need a full lift. You have exactly zero chance of obtaining a ‘perky’ type of look with a cresent or even a donut lift.</p><p>You need a much more extensive lift, like the lollipop lift to obtain this goal. The following is an example of such a lift. (Pablo Prichard, MD, Phoenix Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Type of Breast Lift with Augmentation</h3><p>It is far better to have whatever type of lift you need initially than to try and do something that probably will not work.</p><p>From your pictures, there is no doubt that you need a full lift. Your anatomy defines what type of lift you require, no matter what size implant you use.</p><p>With anything over a Grade I ptosis, a full lift is needed. You appear to have a ptosis between a Grade II & III. (Robert T. Buchanan, MD, Highlands Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I am not a big fan of the crescent lift. There are so few patients who qualify for it and I do not feel the potential problems are worth it. From your pictures you look like you would need a full lift. I often will stage the two procedures if the nipple needs to be moved a long way. This is determined on physical exam. I do perform these operations at the same time quite often. The main thing is that you communicate your goals to a your doctor and go with the one you feel has the most experience and you like their results. Ultimately you have to decide what you are comfortable with. It does appear from your photos that a full lift would be indicated. (Richard J. Brown, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Very hard to believe ANY boarded Ps would off a crescent lift after examine your posted photos let alone seeing you in person ! (Darryl J. Blinski, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Crescent or Full Lift With Augmentation</h3><p>Based on your frontal and oblique photos, it appears that you will need a full lift combined with an augmentation to obtain a result that will come closest to the photo of your ideal result.</p><p>The scar for this will be located in the area where the areola meets the regular breast skin as well as a vertical scar from the bottom of the new areola to the breast fold. A crescent lift will give you a smaller scar, but a less attractive result overall. (Mark Schwartz, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Mastopexy to maximize breast aesthetics</h3><p>Based on your photo, I would recommend a vertical mastopexy and augmentation. A crescent lift is a totally inadequate lift for your anatomy. I tend to use smaller implants for combination breast augmentation and lift surgery.(Scott C. Sattler, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You will need a full lift. You wish photo may not be obtainable but a lift and augmentation will give you a much improved breast shape. (Earl Stephenson, Jr., MD, DDS, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Crescent Lift or Full Lift?</h3><p>In plastic surgery as in life if it sounds too good to be true it probably is. A crescent lift will provide virtually no lift and will distort your areolas. You will do best with a vertical (or lollipop) mastopexy. All the best! (Eric Pugash, MD, Vancouver Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The crescent lift is good for lifting the upper edge of the areola about 1/2- 3/4 inch and is normally reserved for evening minor asymmetry in areola position.</p><p>It is not really a lift and would be totally inappropriate for you. Your nipple and areola appears well below the inframammary line as well as is a significant amount of breast tissue.</p><p>This will require a full lift. While your wish photo may look good to you, it is a woman who never had droop, has not been pregnant, has young and undamaged skin and has very little natural breast tissue.</p><p>You need to be realistic in understanding you may get that look with a pushup bra, but unsupported you will have a very attractive and natural look. Just not that look. (Ronald V. DeMars, MD, Portland Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The Crescent Mastopexy (Lift) should not even be on the table in your situation. I would suggest a Full Mastopexy initially with a Breast Augmentation secondarily.</p><p>I know having two procedures is not ideal in most women’s minds but this would give you the optimal result. Depending on how full you would like to be, you may also be a candidate for a Benelli Mastopexy or “Purse String” Lift.</p><p>You would need to go with larger implants, but this may be a nice compromise. Be sure to seek out a Plastic Surgeon who specializes in breast surgery and has done many of these type of procedures. (James E. Murphy, MD, FACS, Reno Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>To go from your pre-op condition to your desired look, I think a full lift is the only way to go. The main reason is that the crescent lift is predominantly a way to modestly raise the nipple/areola but does not allow any significant shaping. In addition, with a crescent lift the areola will generally expand in size over time while your post-op look shows a very small areolar diameter and more than modest elevation in the nipple position.</p><p>To answer the second part of your question, generally speaking, one can usually still perform a full lift after a crescent lift has been done although there may be minor limitations in optimal shaping due to tightness at the lower portion of the areola when the areola is reduced in diameter. (Robin T.W. Yuan, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In my opinion, you will need a full mastopexy. That will require an incision all the around the areola, vertically down and under the breast (anchor in essence). Clearly, my recommendations are just that and you should be examined by a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon. (Jeffrey Hartog, MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I echo what others have said; a crescent lift will not produce a good result. You have far too much droopiness and loose skin for a crescent lift to work. (Michael S. Hopkins, MD, Albuquerque Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Crescent Lift or Full Lift?</h3><p>I agree with the posts below. A crescent lift does not lift the breast, in only minimally lifts the nipple areola complex, and often leaves an elongated mis-shapen areola. You need a true lift, vertical vs Weiss pattern. (Amy T. Bandy, DO, FACS, Newport Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
