<h3>Finding the &#8220;best&#8221; breast augmentation plastic surgeon for you</h3>
<p>There are several criteria for the breast augmentation plastic surgeon for you. First, he or she must be certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery which means that not only have they completed full training in plastic surgery but have also passed a rigorous testing of their knowledge.</p>
<p>Second, you must feel comfortable with your surgeon and be able to explain your goals and understand how your surgeon is planning to me them. You may need to have consultations with several surgeons in your area until you find one you can trust. Word of mouth is a good way to find out about surgeons in your area so ask around.</p>
<p>And you can ask your regular doctor for recommendations too. (Joseph Serota, MD, Aurora Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Choose a board-certified breast augmentation plastic surgeon.</h3>
<p>Plastic surgery board certification is an excellent place to start your search. There are plenty of &#8220;cosmetic surgeons&#8221; but they are not Plastic Surgeons and so their training and motives are questionable. There is no specific &#8220;best breast augmentation surgeon&#8221; but rather many excellent surgeons across the country.</p>
<p>After certification, be sure to visit several offices in the area, ask to see before and after pictures, and ask if you may talk to any prior patients. Ask any question about the procedure and your surgeon&#8217;s answers should make you feel comfortable or else find another doctor. You will probably find the <strong>breast augmentation plastic surgeon</strong> that you are looking for by doing this. (Douglas S. Steinbrech, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Finding the Best breast augmentation plastic surgeon</h3>
<p>How to Pick the Best Plastic Surgeon for Breast Augmentation. Here is my advice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verify Board Certification by American Board of Plastic Surgery (do this online)</li>
<li>Member of American Society of Plastic Surgery (requirements beyond Board Certification)</li>
<li>Member of American Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (indicates extensive experience in aesthetic surgery &#8211; see below link)</li>
<li>Look at online review sites &#8211; like RealSelf, Health Grades,RateMDs, Google, etc</li>
<li>Look at Before and After photos</li>
<li>What is my instinct or &#8220;gut reaction&#8221; as to who I relate to better, answers my questions more fully and who I basically trust the most.</li>
<li>Finally ask yourself &#8211; if I was to have a complication, who would be the best to take care of me. (Douglas S. Steinbrech, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Finding a cosmetic surgeon</h3>
<p>How to find the best cosmetic surgeon for you.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure the prospective surgeon is certified by the american board of plastic surgery (not Cosmetic surgery)</li>
<li>Ask a trusted friend who they went to.</li>
<li>Look at before and afters of the prospective Dr.&#8217;s work and see if they line up with your aesthetic goals</li>
<li>Ensure the proposed surgery will be in a certified operating room with general anesthesia capabilities even if the procedure is being done under a MAC (not totally asleep)</li>
<li>Go to multiple consults and pick the doctor you feel most comfortable with who meets the above criteria. (Robert E. Zaworski, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Who&#8217;s the best breast surgeon?</h3>
<div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_931" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 210px"><meta itemprop="width" content="200"><meta itemprop="height" content="200"><img itemprop="url" itemprop="image" class="size-medium wp-image-931" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Breast-augmentation-plastic-surgeon-pictures-200x200.jpg" alt="Breast augmentation plastic surgeon pictures" width="200" height="200" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Breast augmentation plastic surgeon pictures</p></div>
<p>There is a 10,000 hr. rule for every profession and avocation. You don&#8217;t get as good as you can be before having 10,000 hrs. of experience. For plastic surgeons that&#8217;s at least 20 years of doing nothing but breast surgeries. I&#8217;d look for grey hair! Breast augmentation plastic surgeon is also the one who will listen to your preferences and doesn&#8217;t tell you what size or shape you should have. Unfortunately many surgeons believe they know better than the patient what size they should have. A highly experienced breast augmentation plastic surgeon can make any size/shape on any patient. It may take more than one operation but it can be done. If you want the best result you can get with one operation just say so and listen to his explanation of the best that can be done with your particular breasts in one operation. There are a thousand different variations. We have done over 30,000 breast implants at my practice. The usual case takes 30 minutes from beginning to end and costs $4400. One revision is free if there is something further the patient wants that can be done safely and effectively. (Robert E. Zaworski, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Finding the best breast augmentation surgeon</h3>
<p>The surgeon&#8217;s photo gallery is an excellent first step. The surgeon&#8217;s skill will be evident. Even the quality of the photography itself is an indication of his attention to detail.</p>
<p>Board certification is a given, as I imagine you already know. Personal referrals, of course.</p>
<p>The surgeon&#8217;s staff and office quality is another indicator. A good doctor makes sure he has excellent people on his team. (Gregory Diehl, MD, FACS, Long Island Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>How Do I Find the Best Breast Augmentation Surgeon</h3>
<p>A good source for cosmetic breast surgeons is Realself.com. Look at the before and after photographs of the surgeons and see which surgeons have contributed to the Q&A section of the website. The next thing is make sure they are board certified Plastic Surgeons then call and schedule a consultation. See how your personalities match up. Check with your friends who have had cosmetic surgery. (Gregory Diehl, MD, FACS, Long Island Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Finding a cosmetic surgeon</h3>
<p>In general, finding a aest breast augmentation surgeon in the world to perform your breast augmentation is a personal choice. Obviously, the surgeon should have all the credientials necessary (Board Certified, etc), but other than that you will need to go for a consultation, look through before/after photos of previous patients, inquire about the number of surgeries he or she has performed (if this is important to you), discuss your expectations for breast size, discuss pre and post care instructions, hospital or facility where the surgery will be performed and finally discuss the finance options.</p>
<p>You should feel comfortable with your surgeon and his or her staff, and you should have all your questions answered to your satisfaction. All doctors are different in how they handle their patients and surgeries so it is a matter of finding one that makes you feel special and excited about your transformation. (Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>6 steps in choosing a best breast augmentation surgeon in the world</h3>
<ol>
<li>Make sure your surgeon comes from a reputable training program and have passed your boards.</li>
<li>Make sure they have hundreds of before and after photos</li>
<li>Make sure your surgeon has patients with whom you can speak to about their experience.</li>
<li>Make sure your surgeon has written text books, journal papers, have spoken about the topic and is a member of ASAPS.</li>
<li>Make sure your surgeon has an accredited surgical facility or associate with a hospital that has a documented low infection rate</li>
<li>Choose a doctor that has a computer morphing program to design your symmetry, size and shape of your ideal final result. (Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Finding a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon</h3>
<p>The best place to start is with the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery ( ASPS). This is the only recognized board in Plastic Surgery. Contact them and they will give you a list of Real Board Certified Plastic Surgeons in your area. That&#8217;s the best place to start. (Joseph Serota, MD, Aurora Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Make Sure Your Surgeon is Board-Certified & Accredited by the American Board of Plastic Surgery</h3>
<p>These days, many different surgeons perform cosmetic surgery including breast augmentation.</p>
<p>In our community, there is actually an ophthalmologist (eye doctor) who went to a weekend course and now puts in breast implants. There are no specific rules or regulations on who can do what procedure in their own facility.</p>
<p>The best way to be sure you are getting a well-trained surgeon is to verify that he or she is a Board certified plastic surgeon who has privileges to do these same procedures in hospitals as well as in their own facilities.</p>
<p>Having been through a plastic surgical training program ensures that they have had the appropriate teaching and experience to know the nuances of the procedure and perform it appropriately.</p>
<p>If in doubt, check on the American Board of Plastic Surgery website for a list of Board certified plastic surgeons in your area. (Johnny Franco, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>Contact the American Society of Plastic Surgeons for a board certified surgeon, check out his/her photos and background, and then look up reviews. (Christopher J. Morea, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>How to find Best plastic surgeon for your procedure</h3>
<p>Most reputable plastic surgeons gain the majority of their patients from referrals. These are happy patients sending their family or friend or the local ob/gyn who has seen the best work. Therefore, I would recommend asking patients who have had procedures done who they recommend. I would also ask your doctors or any healthcare personnel you may work with.</p>
<p>Wonderful sources are OR nurses/personnel and anesthesiologists, as they see most surgeons work. It is also important to see who you mesh with personality wise and which office support staff makes you feel the most comfortable. Lastly, I would review before/after photos of your doctors. (Christopher J. Morea, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Breast Augmentation</h3>
<p>This depends. Where are you located? You can always search the internet and look at photo galleries on surgeons&#8217; websites. Find a board certified plastic surgeon in your area that has results you like. Best, (Marie E. Montag, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Make Sure to Find a Board-Certified Surgeon by the American Board of Plastic Surgery to Perform Your Breast Augmentation</h3>
<p>As with any cosmetic surgical procedure, it is very important that you do your homework and thoroughly research the person you want to perform your operation. You should find a surgeon who is Board certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery. Find out what experience your physician has with this particular procedure and how many he or she has performed.</p>
<p>You should check with your own personal physician to find out their opinion of the surgeon you are considering. You should consult with more than one plastic surgeon if you are considering any type of cosmetic surgery. Make sure you choose a surgeon who is qualified and experiences.</p>
<p>It is also very important that you feel comfortable with the surgeon you choose. It is also very important that your procedure be performed in an approved facility. Make sure you check to find out whether or not the facility has appropriate certification. (Marie E. Montag, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Board Certified Plastic Surgeon</h3>
<p>Finding the best plastic surgeon for breast augmentation will be based on a number of different factors. The most important one is finding a qualified plastic surgeon to perform the surgery. Look for a surgeon who is board certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery. That is one of the most important criteria for a surgeon to meet.</p>
<p>The second is to consult with several plastic surgeons before making your decision. Trust and viewing the surgeons work will help you see if he/she is the right fit for you. That will help to ensure that your happy with your results and that your expectations were acheived. (Christopher J. Davidson, MD, FACS, Boston Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>The Best Breast Surgeon</h3>
<p>There are many excellent plastic surgeons out there &#8211; but there are also many &#8220;want to be&#8221; cosmetic surgeons. When you are trying to find the best breast surgeon for you, first make sure your surgeon is board certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery. With this certification, you can be certain that they are a fully trained plastic surgeonand qualified to perform breast augmentation. The next step is to review their society affiliations &#8211; surgeons who are members of recognized aesthetic societies (the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery) devote a significant portion of their practice to aesthetic surgery, and are recognized by their peer board certified plastic surgeons as being qualified to perform cosmetic surgery.</p>
<p>The final step is personal taste &#8211; even among this group of expert surgeons, personal artistry plays a role in the results that a surgeon achieves. You should spend time reviewing the before and after galleries of the surgeons you are considering, and see if the results match your taste.</p>
<p>Everyone has different anatomy, but the small decisions that surgeons make during an operation do have an impact on the final result. Since you cannot control the way someone thinks, it is best to find someone who thinks the same way that you do. In my mind, this is the best way to end up with a result that will make you happy. (Ricardo A. Meade, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Read reviews, look at pictures, talk to your friends</h3>
<p>Look first for a board certified plastic surgeon. Then look for someone that does primarily or only cosmetic surgery. Then look for someone with years of experience, good reviews and good photographs.</p>
<p>Talk to your friends. Finally, go to meet with the surgeon. If you get a good feeling from the staff, the doctor, and the office, it usually means the fit is right. Simply finding someone nearby that can do surgery can often lead to disappointing results.</p>
<p>It is your body, you need to make the best choice. (Gary Lawton, MD, FACS, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Best Breast Augmentation Surgeon</h3>
<p>In South Florida there are several surgeons that are very good at breast augmentation surgeries. There are some important questions to ask as you should not base your decision about where to have surgery only on price. I would advise you to see a couple different surgeons to get a couple different opinions and see where you feel most comfortable. It is important to ask the right questions during your consultation:</p>
<p>1. Is your surgeon a board certified plastic surgeon?</p>
<p>a. Be sure he or she is a plastic surgeon, there are a lot surgeons that are cosmetic surgeons or board certified in other fields other than plastic surgery. They do not do the same training as a plastic surgeon.</p>
<p>b. You can check the American Board of Plastic Surgery website for a list of plastic surgeons in your area.</p>
<p>2. Does your surgeon commonly perform this procedure?a.Ask to see before and after pictures or look online for reviews on the procedure.</p>
<p>3. Where is the surgery performeda.Is the procedure performed in an accredited surgery center or hospital?</p>
<p>4. Who performs the anesthesia for the procedure?</p>
<p>a. Is an anesthesiologist performing the anesthesia? (Gary Lawton, MD, FACS, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>How to find the best breast augmentation surgeon</h3>
<p>The first step is to find a highly qualified surgeon who is a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon and a member of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. Schedule a consultation and get to know the surgeon.</p>
<p>He should be experienced and capable of showing you hundreds of before and after photos of other breast augmentation patients. Establish a rapport with your surgeon and make sure you feel comfortable asking questions. Evaluate his work based on patient photos and patient satisfaction. Take your time and make an informed decision. Best of luck. (Johnny Franco, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>How to find the a top breast augmentation surgeon</h3>
<p>When choosing your breast augmentation surgeon, you should check their credentials. One of the first and foremost qualifications is Board Certification by the American Board of Plastic Surgery.</p>
<p>You should meet with a board certified plastic surgeon and ask him or her how many procedures they have performed and ultimately you shouldl feel comfortable with your plastic surgeon and what they recommend.</p>
<p>There are a number of options such as saline vs. silicone, high profile vs. moderate profile, round vs. anatomic, smooth vs. texture implants.</p>
<p>Your surgeon should discuss these options with you. (Paul C. Zwiebel, MD, Jacksonville Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Combination of credentials and comfort for breast augmentation surgeon</h3>
<p>You need to start somewhere so starting with credentials. Your doc should be a ASPS member and even an ASAPS member.</p>
<p>These two organizations are fairly exclusive and limit membership to surgeons with residency training and board certification. Equally important is your rapport with the doctor. Can you tell him/her what you want without being judged? Do you like his/her results? Will you feel comfortable telling them you&#8217;re concerned about something? You need to answer these questions for yourself since there are as many doctor personalities as there are doctors. (Paul C. Zwiebel, MD, Jacksonville Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>The best breast augmentation surgeon</h3>
<p>I would start by looking into your surgeon&#8217;s credentials and considering how you found him. Find a board certified plastic surgeon in your area by searching on the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) website: www.plasticsurgery.org. Ask about the incision site, the location of the implant and the type and shape of implant.</p>
<p>Top breast augmentation surgeon should be able to give you good reasons for the particular surgical approach to your particular anatomy. You can also ask the surgeon if they would be able to provide you with patient phone numbers (with the patient&#8217;s consent) to discuss their personal experience. This type of testimonial can be very reassuring. (Ankit Desai, MD, Munster Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Choosing your surgeon for breast augmentation</h3>
<p>The most important factor in the success of elective surgery is your choice of a surgeon; one that is appropriately trained, board certified and with whom you have confidence. (Ankit Desai, MD, Munster Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Breast augmentation surgeon</h3>
<p>I would start by finding a board certified plastic surgeon in your area by searching on the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) website: www.plasticsurgery.org.</p>
<p>Then I would look at as many before and after photos as possible to determine which top breast augmentation surgeons you may want to consult with regarding breast augmentation. Be sure to ask about the incision site, the location of the implant and the type and shape of implant.</p>
<p>Top breast augmentation surgeon should be able to give you good reasons for the particular surgical approach to your particular anatomy. You can also ask the surgeon if they would be able to provide you with patient phone numbers (with the patient&#8217;s consent of course) to discuss their personal experience.</p>
<p>You may need to meet with several <strong>top breast augmentation surgeons</strong> before you find one you are comfortable with for breast augmentation. (Robert Frank, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>How to choose your surgeon</h3>
<p>Board Certification by the Ameridcan Board of Plastic Surgery is the most important thing you need to look for. Make sure you have a good connection with your surgeon and that you are personally comfortable with him or her.</p>
<p>Look carefully at the before and after pictures and try and find patients who look as close to you in the before pictures as you can. Don&#8217;t just look at the &#8220;perfect&#8221; patient pictures. Ask about complications of surgery and how your doctor plans to handle them if they arise.</p>
<p>Ask where the surgery is going to be done and if the facility has met all the appropriate accrediations (Is is a AAAF/Medicare certified facility). Ask about the type of anesthesia you will receive and who will administer the anesthesia. Finally, use your gut instinct and choose someone you can trust. If you have reservations going into the procedure you should probably get another opinion. (Robert Frank, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p>
