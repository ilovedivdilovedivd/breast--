It varies from patient to patent. Some have so little swelling their results at 1 week look as if it has been 6 months. Others have swelling which can last months.</p><p>It is dependent on your body and its ability to heal after surgery, and how well you follow directions and take care of yourself.</p><p>If you push too hard, you will make the swelling worse, and it will last longer. (Gary Lawton, MD, FACS, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It is very common to be about a size bigger right after surgery than what your final result will be. Swelling starts to occur right after surgery and tends to peak in the first week.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4139" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>After about a month you will have lost most of the swelling, but still not completely at baseline. After about another 3 months or so, you will have lost 99% of your swelling, but still you have a pretty good idea at 1 month.</p><p>I wouldn’t spend a lot of money on bras until 3 months as they might not fit perfectly after all the swelling goes away. Also, the more activity you have, the longer the swelling stays, the more that needs to be done as far as lift etc. with surgery, the longer your swelling stays. (Pablo Prichard, MD, Phoenix Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>This is very common, particularly with sub muscular placement. Most bruising and swelling will resolve within two weeks of your surgery. You may also feel discomfort and pain, which is generally well controlled by pain medications.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4137" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Tingling is usually an indication that the sensation in your breasts/nipples is returning and that is a good thing. As your body adjusts to the implants, the tightness you’re experiencing will also resolve. This is usually by the fourth month. (Jerome Edelstein, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Your symptoms sound like normal postoperative recovery. If you have excessive bruising, rapidly developing tightness after breast augmentation (especially if it is on one side), or sudden persistent increase in pain you may have a blood collection and should call your doctor immediately. It doesn’t sound like this is the case for you. Ice and rest may help. Call and make an appointment to see your surgeon to make sure you are healing as expected – I’m sure he or she will be happy to hear from you. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Recovery Process Following Breast Augmentation</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4138" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>After a breast augmentation there will be a period of time where the breast is swollen. The amount of swelling will depend on many factors including the technique employed for the procedure and the natural healing characteristics of the patient. Some swelling and tightness is to be expected. The degree of tightness may be more noticeable in a more petite patient who has received a relatively large implant. In this situation, the natural stretching of the tissues will take longer and the sensation of tightness will be experienced longer. It is very important that you communicate with your surgeon after the operation to make sure that the swelling and tightness are not the result of any internal bleeding. (John J. Edney, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Swelling and tightness after a breast augmentation</h3><p>It is completely normal for you to experience swelling & tightness days after your breast augmentation. Above the breasts (upper pole) is the area where it’ll swell the most. You will feel tightness/pressure that will continue for a couple weeks, as well as the breast augmentation swelling. Slowly this will decrease little by little. (Mel T. Ortega, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Tightness and swelling are extremely common and to be expected following breast augmentation surgery and will vary depending on the unique circumstances. (Otto Joseph Placik, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It can be normal, but it depends on how severe your symptoms are. Where is your PS? You should see your surgeon and have them examine you to ensure that you do not have a hematoma or other collection. (Asif Pirani, MD, FRCS(C), Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Breast augmentation tightness you are describing sounds normal since you are only 7 days post surgery. I would recommend you talk with your surgeon to make sure everything is healing correctly. (Jaime Perez, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Breast augmentation tightness</strong> can be caused by:</p><ol>
<li>Normal swelling/healing process</li>
<li>Hematoma</li>
<li>Seroma</li>
<li>Infection</li>
</ol><p>There is always swelling after breast augmentation and this swelling usually is at its worst day 3-5. Swelling is also more pronounced above the nipple and areola when the implant is placed under the muscle. At 7 days after surgery, breast augmentation tightness that is realtively symmetric without signicant bruising and acceptable discomfort is highly indicative of normal post operative swelling. You should be seing the swelling subsiding over the next week. Continue to minimize your activity as instructed to prevent additional swelling from occuring. All the best, Dr Repta (Remus Repta, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Is swelling and tightness after breast augmentation normal?</h3><p>This new breast augmentation tightness is not normal but not alarming. Most likely the swelling is temporary and as long as it does not continue to get worse, it should resolve over time. If you have any concerns, follow-up with your plastic surgeon. (Robert Heck, MD, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Swelling and Tightness after breast augmentation surgery is very common and will typically resolve in the first several weeks. Swelling on one side that is greater than the other or excessive swelling can rarely indicate bleeding. it is important that you followup with your plastic surgeon and discuss your concerns with him. (Ankit Desai, MD, Jacksonville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Swelling and tightness after having breast augmentation is perfectly normal, so there is nothing to be alarmed about. You will be experiencing these symptoms for at least 1 week after surgery. Every patient is different therefore you may experience it for a bit longer. Just continue to massage the breasts twice a day and follow your post op instructions. If you start to get severe pain and notice things are getting worse then I recommend calling your surgeon. (Shain A. Cuber, MD, Edison Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>What you are experiencing is perfectly normal. Complete resolution of these feeling may take as long as a couple of months. You’ll be fine in the coming weeks. (Vincent N. Zubowicz, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Breast augmentation tightness about 1 week after a breast augmentation is normal. Unless there is extreme pain or significant asymmetry of the swelling, then it usually dissipates on its own.</p><p>The soreness usually goes away as the swelling subsides. Increased activity level usually exacerbates the swelling. (Steven Wallach, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
