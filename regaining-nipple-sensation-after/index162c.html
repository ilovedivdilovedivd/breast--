Nerves generally do not like to be moved, squished, cut, etc. Roughly 85% of the time the sensation to the nipple will be the same. 10% of the time it will be decreased. 5% of the time it will be increased. Each patient is different. Best to sit down with your board certified plastic surgeon and go through all the possibilities. (Jeffrey Roth, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Nipples may be hyposensitive (numb) or hypersensitive after breast implants, but this is limited. I have had patients complain of numb nipples for as long as 6 months after breast implants but I don’t recall any patient having permanent loss of sensation. It’s possible but very unlikely.

</div><p>It is very uncommon to permanently lose nipple sensation after breast augmentation surgery, although not impossible. To minimize this risk as much as possible, I recommend using the incision below the breast (in the infra-mammary crease), placing the implant under the muscle, and not using extremely large implants for your body to avoid over-stretching the nerves.</p><p>Temporary loss of nipple sensation is also very uncommon, and I’ve not seen it last for longer than 6 months. (Amy M. Sprole, MD, Wichita Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Loss of nipple sensation after breast augmentation surgery is not as common as you might think</h3><p>Decreased nipple sensation, or loss of nipple sensation is one of the most severe complications expressed by our patients. Fortunately, it is not as common as we might think.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2299" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-7732a6bae8be1022dc3a3df27362b253">

</div><p>Loss of nipple sensation is a result of injury to the nerve during breast augmentation surgery and is not directly related to the implant itself. When the implant is placed under the breast, or under the muscle, the nerve providing sensation to the nipple is located on the outside portion of the chest wall. The larger the implant size is, the wider the implant base is going to be, and the greater the chance of injury to the nerve is. Placing the implant through incision around the nipple can also increase the risk of injury to the nerve.</p><p>Even though it is impossible to guarantee that you will not have an injury to the nerve, there a few steps you can take to decrease the chance. Proper measuring of the chest wall size and matching with an implant, placing the incision under the breast, going with a conservative sized implant can decrease the chances of injury to the nerve and loss of nipple sensation. Even of the injury to his I nerve occurs on one side, he does not mean that both breasts loose nipple sensation. (Boris Volshteyn, MD, MS, East Brunswick Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Loss of sensation after breast enlargement</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2300" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>There is a 10 to 15% chance of permanent reduction in nipple sensation following breast augmentation. Why? The breast implants not only stretch your skin and muscle, they also stretch the nerves that supply sensation to the nipples.</p><p>The nerves usually recover – but not always. If you choose to undergo breast augmentation, keep in mind that larger implants stretch the nerves more than smaller implants.</p><p>Regardless of the implant size, however, loss of nipple sensation remains an inherent risk of the surgery. (Ronald Friedman, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Loss of sensation after breast implant is uncommon</h3><p>Loss of sensation in the nipple/areola is fortunately an uncommon occurrence. In my experience, permanent loss of of sensation may be due to stretching of the sensory nerves by using very large implants causing a stretch injury or pressure on the nerves, extent of dissection which can damage the nerves, and the size of implant.</p><p>I find that the location of the incision is not usually the reason for loss of sensation. Choosing a board-certified plastic surgeon is important when considering surgery, as it will lower your chances of complications. (Larry S. Nichter, MD, MS, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nipple sensation loss after breast implants</h3><p>Nipple sensitivity is very important to women and it is important to try to preserve this with breast implants. The nerves that supply sensation to the nipple come from the lateral portion of the breast. These nerves are always stretched as part of the procedure and sometimes can be cut. The nerves are often too small to see so they can be cut without knowing. If the nerves are cut then the nipples will often be permanently numb. This does not happen very often. Most patients experience some diminished sensitivity immediately after surgery due to the stretching of the nerves. This often resolves and regains to normal after a few months. For some patients the sensitivity never fully regains and the sides may be different. In some patients the nipples may actually become hypersensitive and this is also due to nerve irritation and the swelling of the nipples after surgery. This also resolves after a few weeks. The important thing about nipple sensitivity issues with breast implants is that if there is loss of sensitivity afterwards this may be permanent and there is nothing that the surgeon can do to correct it. All patients need to know this before having breast implants surgery. (Jason E. Leedy, MD, Cleveland Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Loss of sensation possible with breast implants</h3><p>On average, studies that have looked at loss of sensation after breast augmentation state that it happens about 15% of the time and is unrelated as to where the incision is. In general, smaller implants which require a smaller pocket tend to have a lower incidence of sensation loss than larger implants. (James McMahan, MD, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Sensation After Breast implants</h3><p>The loss of sensation after breast implants depends on 3 things:</p><ol>
<li>your incision location</li>
<li>the size of the implant and</li>
<li>placement of the implant behind the pectoralis muscle.</li>
</ol><p>If there is any numbness, most of the sensation does regain within 3 months of the procedure. However, the loss of sensation with an inframammary fold incision is less than other incisions. It is somewhat higher in the transaxillary and the periareolar incision.</p><p>In summary, the loss of sensation is dependent upon the incision, placement of the implant, and the size of the implant. All of this can be minimized by accurate and meticulous surgical dissection. (Rod J. Rohrich, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nipple sensation after breast implants</h3><p>In my experience the incidence of nipple/areola sensation loss after breast implants is very rare – perhaps close to 1%. This has been my experience regardless of the implant type (saline vs silicone) and incision used (inframammary, areola, axillary).</p><p>I think nipple sensation loss is more likely to occurr when overdissection of the pocket on the side (laterally) is performed and perhaps when excessively large implants are used. (Remus Repta, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>5 tips to minimize the loss of sensation after breast implants</h3><ol>
<li>Plan with your plastic surgeon your options. To minimize the chance of loss of sensations I advise patients to stay away from the incision around the nipple (areole)</li>
<li>Another alternative is to have an incision under the breast where the surgeon will go directly underneath the breast tissue (sub mammary) or the pec muscle (sub muscular. In doing so this will avoid any possible disruption to the sensation.</li>
<li>A second excellent option for leaving no scar on the chest involves making the incision under the arm hidden in the natural crease of the armpit. This way we can go directly under the muscle which is away from the nerves that are responsible for nipple sensitivity.</li>
<li>Regarding your question about different sizes of breasts, your surgeon may use different sized silicone or saline implants and modify the implant pocket shape and size to create more symmetry.</li>
<li>Make sure you review your photos with your surgeon preoperatively and utilize a computer morphing program to allow to design with your surgeon the symmetry, size and shape of your ideal final result. (Douglas S. Steinbrech, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ol><h3>Loss of Sensation after Breast Augmentation</h3><p>The incidence of sensation loss after breast augmentation is around 15%.</p><p>By 3 months the majority of the sensation loss resolves.</p><p>Only about 2% of patients experience permanent sensation loss.</p><p>Factors that influence this are larger implants and use of a periareolar incision. (Paul S. Gill, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Sensory loss in a breast implant patient</h3><p>Permanent loss of sensation in the nipple following breast augment is rare. What is more common but still not usual is temporary sensory loss which resolves in 6-12 months.</p><p>The best incision to preserve sensation in one study was periareolar. The most common incision I use is areolar and permanent sensory loss is less then 2% in my patients.</p><p>When you are talking about a breast lift or reduction the rate of sensory loss for the breast goes up. (Kurtis Martin, MD, Cincinnati Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast and Nipple Sensation After Breast Augmentation</h3><p>In the immediate period after surgery it is often the case that there is some numbness around the breast and even the nipple. </p><p>However, this is almost always temporary. Nipple and breast sensation normally regain within a few months after surgery.</p><p>Certain techniques generally have less affect on nipple sensation. For example, putting a breast implant under the muscle means that the surgery is further away from the nerves going to the nipple and there is less chance of affecting them.</p><p>Also, incisions away from the nipple, such as under the breast or under the arm, imply less chance of impairing the nerves around the nipple than incisions placed under the nipple (peri-areolar). (Cory Goldberg, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Sensation after Breast Augmentation</h3><p>It is very rare that we see loss of sensation after breast augmentation. It is most common when especially large implants are utilized. This is because the dissection or creation of a space is often more aggressive for a larger implant. The small nerves that supply sensation to the nipple can be either stretched or damaged with aggresive dissection.</p><p>Not to worry, only going up a size utilizing a modest implants would allow for a less invasive dissection therefore, the pocket creation would be much smaller. Generally, in this case a patient would not lose much sensation, if any at all. Usually, when someone experiences loss of sensation, it will regain to normal in a few weeks or months. (Michael D. Cohen, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Loss of Sensation After Breast Augmentation?</h3><p>Its not common, but possible. If the nerves get stretched during surgery you can either have lack of sensation or hypersensitivity of the nipples. Usually these are temporary and resolve over time.</p><p>Permanent loss of sensation following breast augmentation surgery is very rare (Naveen Somia, MBBS, PhD, FRACS, Sydney Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>No One Can Ever Guarantee That Your Sensation Will Not Be Altered, But The Odds Are In Your Favor</h3><p>Fear of loss of sensation after breast augmentation is frequently a deterrent for people who are considering this procedure. Unfortunately, no one can ever guarantee that your sensation will not be altered, but the odds are in your favor.</p><p>Almost everyone has numbness right after surgery, but this gets better as the swelling goes down and the nerves start to function again. The majority of sensation usually regains over the first few weeks to months, but it can get better as long as 18 months after surgery. People always worry that the site of the incision will make a difference (i.e.: If they go with an incision around the nipple that this will take away the sensation). In truth, the site of the incision has very little influence on sensation loss. The loss of sensation is much more likely to be linked to the size of the implant that you choose. This is because a larger implant requires the surgeon to create a larger pocket under the muscle and the nerves are more likely to be stretched or cut. Going up a couple of cup sizes is not likely to result in nerve injury but going up drastically makes sensation loss a lot more likely to be permanent. Also, if some form of lifting procedure needs to be done at the same time to correct sagging, the chances of sensation loss are higher. Bottom line: Anyone undergoing a breast augmentation has to be aware that they are at risk for sensation loss, but a high percentage of people maintain good sensation or regains over time. (Marie E. Montag, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>This is a point of discussion I go over with all my patients who come to me asking about breast augmentation.</p><p>There is a small risk you might lose skin sensitivity on one side.</p><p>But the risk depends more on the size of the implant than the inicsion or whether the implant is placed above or under the muscle.</p><p>The anatomy involved with this issue has been researched very well.</p><p>There are about three nerves that contribute to your feeling in the breast and they come out of the side of your rib cage. They connect to each other several times by the time they reach your nipples.</p><p>To completely loose all skin sensitivity all three have to be damaged. How does that happen? When the surgeon is stretching out the tissues along the rib cage for a large implant these nerves can be stretched or cut.</p><p>Usually they aren’t visible and are very small. The research shows that even women with inframmary incisions can loose skin sensitivity if they choose a large implant.</p><p>And almost all of my patients who choose a peri-areolar incision get all their feeling back. So don’t worry about the location of the incision and choose a reasonal sized implant for your frame. (Phillip C. Haeck, MD, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Will I lose nipple skin sensitivity after an augmentation?</h3><p>I tell my patients that if nipple skin sensitivity is extremely important to them, then they should not undergo an augmentation. Studies show that 15% of patients can have some form of altered sensitivity post op. With that said, technique and size of implants play the most important role in ones risk. Blunt lateral dissection and implants that stay within the diameter of your breast offer you a very high chance of maintaining sensitivity. (Christian Prada, MD, FACS, Saint Louis Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Temporary vs Permanent Sensory Changes After Breast Augmentation</h3><p>This is a more complicated questions than they seem! The simple answers are: yes temporarily skin sensitivity changes are common and yes there are things you can do to avoid this. Here is a more detailed summary of what we know to be true about skin sensitivity changes after augmentation:</p><p>Temporary nipple/areola sensation changes are common, affecting the majority of patients. Some patients become too sensitive, while the majority are less sensitive. You will know if these changes are permanent after six months. Permanent sensory loss in the nipple/areola is very rare, &lt;1%. Permanent decreased skin sensitivity of the nipple/areola is uncommon. The rate is somewhere between 2-15%, depending on which study you believe. What can you do to prevent sensory loss? Larger implants are associated with decreased sensation, but not associated with higher risk of complete loss. Interestingly, woman that are naturally large breasted also have much lower nipple/areola skin sensitivity. This means that the nerves to the nipple/areola are being injured by breast size, regardless if the breasts were natural or surgically enhanced. Some older studies have shown that periareolar incision has a higher risk for nipple/areola sensory loss, while some studies say there is no difference. There is some evidence that a inframammary incision will decrease the sensation to the skin of the lower breast. (Bradley A. Hubbard, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Loss of sensation after breast augmentation</h3><p>This loss of skin sensitivity is usually very limited and regains in a few days to weeks. There is a 5% incidence in continued loss of sensation with augmentation surgery.</p><p>Recent studies have verified what was thought all along, that the larger the implant the higher the risk. </p><p>A very precise technique is used to preserve the nerves and therefore the skin sensitivity. (Thomas P. McHugh, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Loss of skin sensitivity after Breast Augmentation</h3><p>Loss of skin sensitivity after breast augmentation is uncommon but dependent on 3 items. They are:</p><ol>
<li>The size of the implant,</li>
<li>The site of surgical incision,</li>
<li>Surgical technique. There are 3 nerves that supply skin sensitivity to the breast and these may be stretched or cut during surgery. The nerves have numerous interconnecting branches.
<p>The most important things to consider is accurate planning, proper size, and good surgical technique. </p>
<p>Regardless, unless all three nerves are cut the skin sensitivity after surgery usually regains by 3 months. (Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p>
