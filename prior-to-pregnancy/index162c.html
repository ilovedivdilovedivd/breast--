</div><p>I suggest that if having children are a strong consideration in a woman’s near future, that they should consider delaying breast augmentation surgery until after they have completed their family. (Michael A. Epstein, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast implants before or after babies</h3><p>The pregnancy will likely change your breasts with or without implants. The chances of needing a second surgery on your breast after the initial breast augmentation goes up if you have subsequent pregnancies.</p><p>My usual suggestion is if you are planning on having a baby within 3 years or less, I say wait. If you are not sure when, or it is going to be longer, then I will go ahead and perform the augmentation and then we can deal with any changes needed, if and when the pregnancy occurs, but that has given you at least a few years with your augmented breast prior to any changes that might occur.

</div><p>It is perfectly fine to have a Breast Augmentation Surgery before having children. Breast implants will not affect breast feeding. (Michael A. Fiorillo, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Augmentation and Children</h3><p>This is really an individual choice. Things definitely change when having children. You may gain or lose breast tissue afterwards. Your skin may stretch and thin out. If you know you are having children soon then I would wait.</p><p>If you are uncertain then it seems to me that you should be happy with yourself and how you look in the meantime. It may be possible that you may need more surgery after having children but not always. (David Nicholas Csikai, MD, Jacksonville Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast augmentation need not wait until after having children</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2187" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>You do not need to wait until you are finished having children before having your breast augmentation. I have had many patients who have had breast augmentation and then had children later without any problems.</p><p>You can breast feed your children after having breast augmentation. I would not recommend having breast augmentation immediately after giving birth to a child. However, I do recommend waiting from six to nine months after having a child before having breast augmentation. (James Tang, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Augmentation and future pregnancies</h3><p>If you are planning on having children soon, you should hold off on breast augmentation surgery. If you are not planning on having children for several years, I would recommend that you proceed with breast augmentation surgery.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2188" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-5c2b43db30d37388c501e254aa351542">

</div><p>Breast augmentation may interfere with your ability to breastfeed. If breastfeeding is extremely important to you, wait until your family is complete before undergoing breast augmentation. (Andrew P. Giacobbe, MD, Buffalo Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Implants – Should I Wait Until After Pregancies to Get Implants</h3><p>There is no reason, in general, to wait until after you’re finished having children to have this procedure. You may want to for any of a number of reasons, but it’s not necessary.</p><p>1) Both nipple sensation and the ability to breast-feed can be altered by this procedure. Permanent problems or changes are rare, but they can occur. Additionally, some women cannot breast-feed even without breast implants. So while there are no clear date supporting the advisability of deferring this procedure until after pregnancies, it’s understandable that someone might want to.</p><p><amp-img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2189 amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Pregnancy-after-breast-augmentation-photos-200x150.jpg" alt="Pregnancy after breast augmentation photos" width="200" height="150" layout="fixed"></amp-img>2) Your breasts will undoubtedly be different after pregnancies. It’s possible that you might need to have an additional procedure, such as a lift, skin tightening, etc., if you gain and lose weight for any reason, including pregnancy. Again, though, that doesn’t mean you should wait. pregnancies do not always happen as planned, and you may want to make decisions such as these just because you want to, not because of what you expect your life to be like in a few years. Bottom line: LOTS of women have implants before pregnancies, and most are extremely happy with their decisions. (Alan M. Engler, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Breast implants is the most common plastic surgery procedure done in this country. Obviously it is extremely popular because women like it. When shoulds you have it done?</p><p>If you are anticipating a pregnancy in the very near future, it would be best to wait until after the pregnancy.</p><p>If not, go for it. You will have all that time to enjoy the benefits of the surgery. (E. Anthony Musarra II, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Implants before or after surgery is a personal choice.</h3><p>This question comes up often and should be discussed during your consultation with a fully credentialed Plastic Surgeon.</p><p>If you are planning on a pregnancy in the near future then wait until after you have completed your family to have breast surgery. Pregnancy often changes the shape and tone of your breast in a manner that may change the surgical plan needed to achieve optimal results.</p><p>If having children is further away in your plans then breast implants may be a good choice for you. In most cases, breast implant surgery does not interfere with breast feeding.</p><p>To improve your chance of maintaining normal function it is best to avoid incisions near the nipple and it may be slightly better to have the implant in a sub-pectoral location. Women with implants who do breast feed are at risk for developing mastitis (infection in the breast) and this may increase your risk for developing contractures.</p><p>All patients who have breast implants surgery should understand that additional breast surgery during your lifetime is expected. You can reduce your risk of revisional procedures by choosing smaller implants and be choosing a qualified Plastic Surgeon. (Mathew C. Mosher, MD, Vancouver Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Timing of Breast implants Before or After Children</h3><p>It really comes down to a personal choice in whether having a breast implants before or after children. Patients can choose to have breast implants before children as it does not affect their ability to breastfeed.</p><p>One thing that is important to know is that implants have a life span of 10 – 15 years and sometimes with multiple pregnancies breast implants can prematurely get harder, but that is an infrequent occurrence. It really becomes a personal choice. Consult with an experienced, board certified plastic surgeon to guide you if you want to have a breast implants before having children. (Rod J. Rohrich, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>When is the best time for a Breast implants</h3><p>It all depends on your time frame. Are you considering having children in the near future? If so, I would advise you to wait as your breasts will change with pregnancy.</p><p>If there are no immediate plans for children I would suggest that you meet with a board certified plastic surgeon to discuss your options. I have plenty of patienst in the twenties who had babies in their thirties and were very happy they had breast implants when they did. (Christine Sullivan, MD, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast feeding and Breast implants</h3><p>Timing for breast augmentation surgery is a personal one. If you have been wanting a breast implants for years, there is no reason to wait. Breast implants (especially if the implants are saline and are placed under the pectoralis muscle) should not affect breast feeding.</p><p>The breast implant is away from the breast, so adverse affects on breast feeding are rare. However, if you are planning a pregnancy in the near future, then waiting may be the better option. The breast will go through a lot of changes with pregnancy, so the shape may be different after pregnancy and breast feeding.</p><p>That’s the dilemma-do the surgery now and enjoy the results or wait with all the unknowns about the timing of pregnancy, breast feeding, etc. This one of those decisions, that each patient has to decide for themselves. Best wishes.(Michael Vincent, MD, Rockville Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
