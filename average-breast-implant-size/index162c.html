(Julio Garcia, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Correct size of implants</h3><p>Since bra sizes are not consistent, it is difficult to guarantee a specific bra size. Trying on sizers is not perfect, but is the closest way to see what it might look like on you.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1806" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-5c2b43db30d37388c501e254aa351542">

</div><p>If you felt the 400 cc implant was too heavy, and the 350 cc implant was too small, you may like 375 cc implant. Twenty-five cc’s is not a big change in size.</p><p>All 3 sizes are a reasonable consideration for your height and size. Implants placed behind the muscle will look smaller due to the compression from the muscle. At this point if you are unsure, let your plastic surgeon guide you. (Connie Hiers, MD, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Average breast implant size</h3><p>Your dilemma is a common one. The amount of worry over this very small volume difference is something that is certainly concerning to you and me when we work together in a custom sizing appointment. Your statistics really have to do with your body habitus.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1805" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-c7b3e0b9854ed013c1592278f6f706f4">

</div><p>What you should really decide upon is whether or not you can project a bit into the future and say whether you will accept that one more ounce for the peace of mind of whether or not you undershot your volume. Other physicians who are answering have talked about the statistical analysis of 4% or 1 or 2 tablespoons. With a small padded bra you could make your smaller implant look bigger.</p><p>If you feel like you are just a little bit too small, you really don’t want to undergo a re-operation for the sake of 1 ounce. You and your surgeon should talk this over carefully and at some point you have to make a decision that you are going to make the choice and not cause yourself the anxiety and dismay of having to consider a re-operation for the sake of a very small difference. Have the joy of knowing you can have a great result with either choice! (Paul Vanek, MD, Cleveland Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Choose some pics of what you hope to look like</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1807" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Keep in mind that cup size is largely dependent on who makes the bra – when choosing implants it is better to focus on the volume and shape that you desire using <strong>average breast implant size</strong> as a rough guideline. Similarly, trying on implants in a bra is an inexact science – once the implant is covered by your own tissue it looks smaller. Choose a range of sizes (for example 350-400cc) and articulate what you want to your surgeon so that he or she can use sterile sizer implants to give you the look you want. It is sometimes helpful to the surgeon if you find a couple of pictures of girls with a similar size body to yours whose size and shape you like. If available, Vectra imaging (a 3-D imaging technology) is the best way I’ve found to choose a size preoperatively. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast implant sizing</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1808" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>As far as how many cc’s, a physical examination to obtain measurements of your chest wall and breast width would help to answer your question more accurately. Since cup size is a ratio of breast volume to chest circumference it is tough to estimate exact post-operative bra sizes. Another confounding factor is that there is no standardization of this ratio by bra manufacturers. However, a loose rule of thumb is that it takes about 150cc to make a change in cup size in a 32 bra size. Therefore if you are a 34A-B, adding 400 will likely increase you a bit more than 2 cup sizes, likely (but not for sure) making you a full C or D depending of how full of an A or B you are now.</p><p>Keep in mind, this is a very rough estimate and the goal is not a specific bra size but a look you are trying to achieve.One tool I find helpful is Vectra 3D imaging, where I can virtually implant the different sizes and styles of implants. The 3D image of your chest morphs into a pretty accurate representation of your final result with some limitations of course.Good luck on your consultation and in making your final decision. (Luis H. Macias, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Natural breast implants</h3><p>All of the implant choices you have mentioned are within the realm of appropriate for your frame and desires.</p><p>You can “try on” breast implants in your plastic surgeon’s office to get a better sense of what you feel more comfortable with.</p><p>Alternatively, your plastic surgeon can use a “sizer” or disposable implant to get your size more precisely in line with your desires.</p><p>The overall difference between 375 and 400 and between moderate and moderate plus is relatively subtle. (Lara Devgan, MD, MPH, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Choice of breast implant</h3><p>This is a tough question to answer without consulting with you. There are many things to discuss. First, you are taller than average, and taller women need larger implants to achieve the same breast size. A C cup on a woman 5’0″ tall is not the same as a woman 5′ 7″ tall. The difference is easily 100cc. Second, all breasts are not created equal and some have more laxity or looseness in the envelope which requires a larger implant.</p><p>If you are young and have not had children this is very different from the women who have had children and experienced the breast expansion that comes with pregnancy. From a profile standpoint, think of the moderate plus profile as a more projected implant and the moderate profile as a wider implant size for size. As you go bigger for your base breast width you have to go to a higher profile.</p><p>And last but not least, most surgeons are not making decisions about 25 cc, but +/-50 cc to see a noticeable difference in your breast size. (Stephen J. Vega, MD, Rochester Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>What will my cup-size be after breast augmentation</h3><p>Dear Rapatn:Thank you for your question.Your concern is a common consideration for many patients.The difference in volume you are considering is 50 cc between the two implants, or slightly under an ounce. As an aide to our patients we often recommend to go with the larger of the two as a general rule of thumb. As for what size bra you will be, I have found such a significant range between manufacturers that it is hard to honestly determine what the final cup size will be prior to surgery. (Sergio P. Maggi, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Sizing and breast augmentation</h3><p>The bottom line is no one can guarantee you a cup size. You can have the same size breasts and walk out of 2 different stores with 2 different bra sizes – so do u want a Victoria’s secret C or a Saks Fifth Avenue C? I am being a bit facetious but the bottom line is a cup size can not be guaranteed. Far more important is matching the implant to your tissues for the least amount of problems and knowing the consequences of placing a larger implant than is ideal. It’s not like buying a car where you can order the LX or extended cab without consequences. An experienced and board certified surgeon can guide you through the choices. (Matthew H. Conrad, MD, Wichita Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How do I determine the right size implant?</h3><p>I feel that the ‘cc’ size of implants has received an undue amount of attention in the public eye. The reality is that the size of an implant that will achieve your goals best is determined by many things unrelated to the specific CC amount.</p><p>The most important aspect is your chest dimensions – how wide your breast is. This provides the foundation for choosing an implant. Another important aspect is the degree of projection of the implant. Pre-operative planning is very important to identify goals, expected outcomes, and approximate implant volume, but the final implant choice is up to the judgement of your surgeon based upon what he or she determines during surgery.</p><p>If your concern is primarily ‘should I go a little bigger or a little smaller,’ more patients request size changes for an increase in size, not a decrease, so I would err on the side of larger.</p><p>However, the caveat is of course is that the implant must not be so large as to cause undue risk of complications. (Bryan Correa, MD, The Woodlands Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Choosing implant size</h3><p>Trying on breast implant sizers is just the starting point in choosing implant size, as implants look much different once they are covered by your breast and possibly also your muscle. It is easy to get caught up in choosing a “perfect” cup size, but this, too is just a rough estimate, as cup size can vary significantly between brands. You have already done a great job choosing a range you are comfortable with.</p><p>The next step is to look at photos of other women who are built like you to find the size and shape breast that you find beautiful. As for choosing a profile, talk to your surgeon about what you like and don’t like – do you want more cleavage? does the idea of having some fullness on the side bother you? Your surgeon should be able to guide you to the right profile by talking through your desires and concerns. (Meghan Nadeau, MD, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Implant needed to go to a full C cup from an A cup</h3><p>Generally, the final size you will be is based on the implant volume you select. My rule of thumb is about 240 cc equals a one cup increase (or 8 fluid ounces- check it out on a measuring cup). The difference of 25 cc (375 vs.400) is virtually unnoticable and if it fits with the dimensions of your breast I would recommend the slightly larger implant, though there is no wrong answer between the two. Implant style however (moderate versus moderate plus) will have a more dramatic effect on the outcome. Ideally, try to consult with a plastic surgeon that can show you with 3D imaging (Canfield Vectra for example) the anticipated results with the various sizes and shapes of implants you are considering through computer simulation.
