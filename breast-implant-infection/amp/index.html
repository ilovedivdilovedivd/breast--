If the infection is superficial and due to a stitch abscess, it can be treated with local wound care.</p><p>However, an infection of the implant itself may necessitate surgery and implant exchange or removal.</p><p>In our Jacksonville plastic surgery practice, we utilize a multiple methods to prevent an implant infection including only touching the implant once, giving intravenous prophylactic antibiotics, using an antibiotic solution to wash the pocket, and even covering the nipple, which can contain bacteria.

</div><p>What you have described seems more like a “stitch abscess” than an infection of the breast implant. Stitch abscesses are not uncommon especially if a lift was done at the same time as augmentation (simply more suture material present).</p><p>Stitch abscesses are possible with any type of absorbable suture, but seem to be a little more common with Vicryl suture in my experience. Local wound care and patience are usually all that are needed.</p><p>A breast implant infection usually causes more symptoms like fevers, pain or discomfort, warmth, mile erythema, or chronic drainage. This is much less frequent and more serious. This is usually treated aggressively with antibiotics and may need to be treated with surgical drainage or removal of the implant.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2557" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Your plastic surgeon should be able to help reassure you and help this resolve. Sometimes being patient is the hardest thing to do, but the most helpful. (Richard H. Fryer, MD, Salt Lake City Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Infection After Breast implant</h3><p>While very rare, <strong>breast implant infection</strong> can be devastating, and may lead to loss of the implant, and even systemic sepsis. The key to managing infection after breast implant is to determine whether it is superficial, and therefore, not in contact with the implant, or deep and in contact with the implant.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2559" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Your infection sounds like it is superficial, likely resulting from an infected know in the suture, Once the know is removed and any loose tissue at the wound edge is cleaned away, this will generally heal on its own.</p><p>If redness persists, the infection has spread into the skin as cellulitis, and antibiotics are going to be required to help it. Once infection or puss is in contact with the implant, it is extremely difficult to save. If caught very early, high dose intravenous antibiotics may be successful. Generally, however, a truly infected implant in contact with bacteria, should be removed and replaced after 3 months time to clear the infection.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2558" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Even if antibiotics alone suppress the infection, there is a much higher risk of capsular contracture down the road and deformity. Keep your wound clean and apply topical antibiotic according to your surgeon’s recommendations. (Karen Vaniver, MD, Kennewick Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How to Deal with Infection After Breast implant</h3><p>You seem to be having what is called stitch abscess where some bacteria travel through the hair follicle and infect the stitch and cause an abscees. This usually resolves with just local wound care and topical antibiotic which you are already using.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2556" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>It seems that the stitch that was used is long lasting and may have to be removed if not absorbable type. There are two types of breast implant infections. The first will usually occur during the first week after the breast enhancement surgery and can be treated with antibiotics if caught early enough. In extreme cases, the breast implant must be taken out and left out for a few months prior to replacing the breast implant. The second type of breast implant infection is a more smoldering type of infection. However Breast implant infection is very rare especially when done properly in accredited centers and the surgeon takes all necessary precautions. (Tarick K. Smaili, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2561" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Your surgeon needs to determine if this infection is a superficial wound infection, or a deeper true implant infection. Superficial wound infections do occur, but should not jeopardize the implant as long as it is treated appropriately. Many times patients think that they have a wound infection, and in reality all it is is a suture that is poking through the skin incision. The hallmark of an implant infection is a red, tender breast. Fevers are sometimes associated. A true implant infection demands immediate treatment with antibiotics if you plan on salvaging the implant. This sometimes requires intravenous antibiotics. Talk with your surgeon. (Kevin Brenner, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Infection after breast augmentation surgery</h3><p>Breast augmentation is the most popular cosmetic surgery in the United States. Like all other cosmetic surgeries, a risk for infection doesn’t exist. If you are concerned about the status of your breast implants or feel that you may have infection, it is essential that he returned to your plastic surgeon immediately.</p><p>They will be concerned as well. They will assess your breast and determine if you indeed have infection and what treatment is necessary. Depending on the severity of the infection, it may even be necessary to remove the breast implant. The longer you delay in seeking attention, the more likely this may become.</p><p>To learn more about breast augmentation, see photos, and help you decide which one is best for you, please visit us at the link below. (Pat Pazmino, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Wound infections after breast surgery</h3><p>You do not appear to have an infected breast implant, but a region of delayed wound healing along your breast. With proper wound care, these regions will heal. Do speak with you plastic surgeon and have him personally evaluate this region of your breast. (Scott C. Sattler, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast implant with possible wound infection</h3><p>What you describe sounds like a superficial wound infection. Most importantly, I would follow closely with your plastic surgeon. This should heal with local wound care, but if an implant infection exists, further surgery may be required. (Dustin L. Reid, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Usually the best treatment is to remove the implant, treat the infection, and then replace the implant sometime later. If the incision, and not the implant. is the problem then local care will usually suffice. However, these are also unusual and I would be fearful that you have something deeper. As others have recommended, revisit your surgeon.  (Vincent N. Zubowicz, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Infection after breast surgery</h3><p>As everyone else has posted, you need to contact and see your surgeon. Infection at the suture line are often related to sutures. These can often be treated with local antibiotics and wound care.</p><p>For deeper infections, particularly those within the implant capsule, an aggressive approach is warranted. This may include IV antibiotics and sometimes a removal of the implant. Do not try to manage these issues on your own, seek the care of your surgeon! (David Bogue, MD, Boca Raton Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Call your surgeon immediately if you suspect infection</h3><p>You need to call your surgeon immediately for any evidence of infection after breast surgery. There are several problems with breast implant infections: The implant itself has no blood supply. As such, it cannot adequately fight off infection. In addition, current research has shown that bacteria produce bio-films which effectively wall off the infection from your immune system.</p><p>By doing so, your body cannot adequately treat the infection and it persists. Finally, studies have pointed to even low-grade infection as an inciting factor for capsular contracture The simple answer is that you should see your surgeon and ask them how to proceed from here. (Gregory A. Buford, MD, FACS, Denver Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Wound infection VS Implant infection</h3><p>The evaluation should be by the surgeon NOT the nurse. It is possible you have a suture reaction and may be localized infection. However this should be evaluated thoroughly by the surgeon, blood work, sonogram etc.</p><p>If this is suspect of implant infection it should be removed with complete capsulectomy , cultures should be taken for regular bacteria and exotic bacteria including Mycobacteria, fungus, and some times must do a tissue culture. SEE YOUR PS IMMEDIATELY. (Samir Shureih, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Breast infection after surgery is not something that should be neglected. It is important to see your surgeon to evaluate this.</p><p>Sometimes, there are superficial infections of the stitches that can be treated conservatively. If, however, the infections becomes more global and affects your breast itself, significant intravenous antibiotics will be required, if not removal of the implant.</p><p>Your surgeon will want to intervene before the small <strong>breast infection after surgery</strong> becomes a larger one! (Adam David Lowenstein, MD, FACS, Santa Barbara Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Whenever there is a wound problem but especially in an early post-operative patient, it is my practice to see post-operative patients as soon as possible to clear things up.</p><p>Sometimes early intervention can improve the outcome and avoid further problems. I see all the post-operative patients in my private practice. That is my “higher level of care.” See your surgeon and show him the area that is bothering you to get this cleared up. (John P. Di Saia, MD, Orange Plastic Surgeon)</p><p class="amp-wp-inline-9ebb7490943b27acf21bc3342b5bd50d">IT sounds as if you are having more of a suture reaction than an implant breast infection after surgery. I concur with the other surgeons and advise you to seek the evaluation by a surgeon. Your wound care may actually do more harm by interfering with the healing process. Discuss your options for managment with your surgeon (Otto Joseph Placik, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast augmentation wound infection vs spitting stitch</h3><p class="amp-wp-inline-9ebb7490943b27acf21bc3342b5bd50d">While a small “spitting” suture is really nothing to worry about, I would very much prefer your surgeon, NOT a nurse see you and determine whether a wound breast infection after surgery is taking place. IF your surgeon thinks a wound infection is taking place, it needs to be treated promptly and aggressively with the appropriate antibiotics.</p><p class="amp-wp-inline-9ebb7490943b27acf21bc3342b5bd50d">In other words, the wound need to be cultured and antibiotics need to be chosen based on their ability to kill the specific bacteria present in YOUR wound. The use of shotgun antibiotic therapy often fails (“Have been on two types of antibiotics and they go away and then come back”).</p><p class="amp-wp-inline-9ebb7490943b27acf21bc3342b5bd50d">If untreated, such a superficial infection will cause CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE and may result in your having to have your implants removed for at least 6 months to allow it to heal properly. (Peter A. Aldea, MD, Memphis Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast augmentation infection?</h3><p class="amp-wp-inline-9ebb7490943b27acf21bc3342b5bd50d">If you are having chronic problems with your incision and the wound is open, you may have breast infection after surgery. You should see your surgeon immediately to be evaluated. If it is a superficial skin breakdown than local wound care may be all that you need.
