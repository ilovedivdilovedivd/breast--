</div><p>There are three different types of lifts and which one to use can be tailored to the individual. Many women who only need a small lift can have a peri-areolar lift; this is where the only incisions are at the border of the areola and the normal skin.</p><p>These incisions tend to hide very well as it is at a natural transition. There is also a vertical and full mastopexy (anchor lift) for patients that have extra skin or breast that have completely fallen.</p><p>The most import part of making this decision is having a discussion about your goal with a board certified plastic surgeon. He or she can help guide you as to which procedure will be best for you to accomplish your goals. (Ralph R. Garramone, MD, Fort Myers Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast lift vs Implant alone</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1204" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>This decision is made easier by measuring where the nipples are in relation to the breast. In general younger women with little drooping can use the implant alone. Women who have had children and breast fed have more significant drooping and may need a lift and an implant. (Ralph R. Garramone, MD, Fort Myers Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Lift vs. Breast Implants</h3><p>The choice depends on many factors among which is the degree of the drooping, the position of the nipple, in regard to the inframammary crease, the quality of the skin, the size of the implants, and the patients expectations. The best answer is given individually at the time of consultation and different options are discussed. (Raja Srour, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>BREAST LIFT VS BREAST AUG</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1205" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-c5a320fa69312d561fc6cd54de925dff">

</div><p>A good candidate for a breast augmentation wants to increase the size of her breasts and has minimal ptosis or sagging. With age and pregnancy some women’s breast can begin to sag causing a need for the breasts to be lifted. A mastopexy or breast lift is used to reposition the nipple and thus lifting the breast. A breast augmentation can be done in conjunction with a breast lift for those women who wish to increase the volume of their breasts while lifting the breasts.</p><p>In some patients with ptosis, placing an implant is sufficient to correct any sagging but that is not always the case. Without a physical examination it is difficult to give a suggestion as to whether or not you would need an augmentation, a lift, or both. I recommend scheduling a consultation with a board certified plastic surgeon to discuss the best surgical plan for you. (Michael Miroshnik, MBBS, FRACS, Sydney Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1207" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Usually a patient needs a breast lift after childbirth since the breasts are filled with milk they become larger and after it is gone they sort of deflate and loose projection, and you can see the nipple is way down, also what can cause this is weight loss these are the most common cases where a patient would need lift to position the nipple in its place and reshape and will the implant give a fuller and firm look to your breasts.</p><p>But all this has to be evaluated by your PS he will let you know what would be your best option. (Michael Miroshnik, MBBS, FRACS, Sydney Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Breast Lift and Breast Augmentation are two very different surgeries for a different set of issues.</p><p>Breast lift is for lifting the breast up so that the nipple/areola is in a more aesthetic place and in some cases the breast can be enhanced with a small implant to give more volume to the breasts.</p><p>This is usually performed on women after childbirth that have lost breast elasticity and are experiencing sagging breasts.</p><p>Breast Augmentation is usually performed on women that have small breast or who wish to have a size or two large.</p><p>This can be performed on women after childbirth, when they have loss considerable amount of volume but their nipple/areola has not changed or sagged. (Thomas A. Mustoe, MD, FACS, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>This is one of the most complex issues I face with my patients seeking breast enhancement. Size is a key question that is settled upon first. If a woman is ok with her size in a bra, and the breast has adequate glandular tissue, a breast lift can be done but may require a full peri-areolar and inverted-T incision to give the breast a nice aesthetic shape.</p><p>If an increased size is desired, clearly an implant is needed, but then whether a lift will also be necessary depends upon how much ptosis (droopiness) is present and what volume implant will provide the desired size.</p><p>Generally, the larger the implant the more internal lift is provided and less skin tightening and scars are required. This is a detailed conversation to have with your plastic surgeon, and I have found that 3D imaging with computer simulation is very valuable during the consultation. (Stanley Castor, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In general one should consider breast lifting if the level of the nipples falls below the crease under the breasts. The tougher decision is when one is in that border region- the nipple is at about the height of the crease – a good discussion with your surgeon along with an exam will help with the decision. Implants can be used with a lift to improve the fullness in the upper part of the breasts and also of course increase one’s volume. Hope this helps! (Arthur G. Handal, MD, Boca Raton Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast lift or breast augmentation, or both</h3><p>It depends on how saggy your breasts are and if you don’t like how they look. There is a way to measure the amount of sagging, but it’s really more up to you to figure out if you don’t like the drooping. If you prefer firmer, perkier breasts, then a breast lift would be good (or implants with a higher profile). If you don’t mind the more natural look, then you won’t need a breast lift. (Michael Constantin Gartner, DO, Paramus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>That’s an excellent question and a challenging one to answer. Many patients seeking breast rejuvenation may be considering a breast lift, a breast augmentation or a combination of these procedures. The truth is is that there is no one correct answer as each individual seeking breast rejuvenation has their own unique goals and aesthetic ideals. The best answer is to seek an opinion from a specialist plastic surgeon and find a solution that is right for you. (Michael Constantin Gartner, DO, Paramus Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Augmentation and/or Mastopexy (breast lift)?</h3><p>At the time of your consultation, the plastic surgeon will discuss your desired size, examine your breasts and chest wall, and depending on those factors will determine the need for implant, lift or both. If you are pleased with your size, but find your breasts are sagging or not in the correct position, then a breast lift alone is a feasible option. However, in some cases a small implant with a breast lift is recommended to fill out the upper medial aspect of the breast. Also, if an augmentation is desired, depending on the size you wish to be, a lift may not be necessary if the implant size envelopes the skin enough. All of these parameters are very individualized to the patient and are discussed in great detail at her consultation. (Guy Watts, MBBS (Hons), FRACS (Plast), Perth Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>When do you need a lift</h3><p>Although the answer will vary with each individual, there are a couple of quick tests. If your nipple – areloa are actually below the level of your breast fold, or your nipple is 21 cm or more from the hollow at the top of your breastbone, you will probably need a lift for your breast to look ideal again.</p><p>Be cautious of surgeons who recommend large implants to solve this alone. It is a temporary solution in most cases. (Matthew H. Steele, MD, Fort Worth Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>If there is no breast tissue at all or very little breast tissue then an augmentation is what is usually indicated.</p><p>If there is droopy tissue with redundant breast skin envelope and loss of breast tissue such that the nipple is positioned much lower than the inframammary fold then a breast lift is usually indicated (with or without an implant). (Matthew H. Steele, MD, Fort Worth Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>A lift is performed if your nipple falls below the level of your inframammary fold. </p><p>This is the fold or groove underneath your breast. If your nipple is at or below this level, you likely need a lift. </p><p>An augment is performed if you want more volume in your breast.</p><p>It is possible to re-arrange breast tissue during a lift to give the appearance of an augment. It is important that you know that if you have a combined augment and lift that the two surgeries act against one another.</p><p>The weight of an implant will accelerate the downward effect of gravity on your breast tissue. Without pictures, it is difficult to suggest what you need. I suggest you see an experienced physician in your area for advice. (Frank Campanile, MD, Denver Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In my experience, many patients need both. I see a lot of women  postpartum for these procedures. </p><p>Childbirth and nursing result in both  breast tissue volume loss and breast drooping. And with every pregnancy,  this situation increases. So, as part of a “mommy makeover” for example,  patients have both a breast lift and augmentation.</p><p>Of course, there are  situations where only one of these procedures is needed. However, be  aware that breast augmentation, which means greater/heavier breast  volume, increases the chances and time frame that a woman will need a  breast lift as well. (Frank Campanile, MD, Denver Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>5 tips for deciding between breast augmentation and a breast lift or both</h3><ol>
<li>Augmentation in a patient who has had childbirth or weight loss is a terrific way to restore volume and lift with a small incision.</li>
<li>Do not fear the implant. I t is your friend that gives you the size and shape you once had with a much smaller incision than a lift. Speak with your surgeon about implant options.</li>
<li>Patients who desire a lift but do not desire larger cleavage may do well with a lift alone.</li>
<li>For patients who want a lift and more cleavage/ volume, they will require a lift and an implant.</li>
<li>For maximum results, make sure your PS has a photo surgery morphing program to be able to design the post-operative result that you want in your initial consultation. (Douglas S. Steinbrech, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ol><h3>Lift vs Augmentation</h3><p>A Breast Lift is best when you are happy with your breast size but you want them lifted and have excess skin that can be removed but lifting areola up and reshape. A Breast Augmentation is to enhance your breast size using an implant, in some cases an implant can give you a lift and enchace your cleavage and give a perky look. Most patients that get both procdures would like to enhance breast size while getting rid of excess skin usually post pregnancy. (Douglas S. Steinbrech, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Lift vs. Breast Augmentation</h3><p>The breast consultation is probably the most important thing you need to do to determine whether you need a breast lift or breast implants.</p><p>At the exam, your surgeon should access the position of the nipple, as well as, the gland in relation to the inframammary fold.</p><p>There are certain aesthetic considerations to think about when making this decision.</p><p>If the breast does not hang below the inframammary fold and the nipple does point upward, then refilling the breast envelop should provide restoration of aging or post pregnancy.</p><p>If the breast is hanging below the inframammary fold, often referred to as the pencil test, it has to be lifted and has to be brought up to the level to a more youthful level breast.</p><p>This may solve the problem completely, or may provide a more uplifted breast with still need to fill volume. If this is the case, then an implant will likely need to be employed.</p><p>The implant doesn’t need to be terribly large in order to provide upper pole fullness and can look very natural if done properly. (Saeed Marefat, MD, Washington DC Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You will need a consultation to determine if you need an implant or and implant with lift. Please seek advice from a board certified plastic surgeon. (Dennis Dass, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast augmentation versus breast lift</h3><p>One way to think about it is to separate the two procedures conceptually. Breast augmentations provide volume while breast lifts elevate and reshape the breasts. While some surgeons will use implants to provide a lifting effect, this can be subtle and often results in larger breasts that still sag.</p><p>The ultimate determination is based on an examination of your breasts. This will evaluate your nipple position in relation to the breast mound as well as the position of the breasts on the chest wall. If either the nipple or the breast mound shows decent, then a lift should be included as part of the procedure. Placement of an implant without a lift will not correct this.</p><p>It is common to use an implant in addition to a lift. This will provide restoration of volume lost from prior pregnancies or weight changes. It also can provide a longer lasting superior volume, which can make for a more pleasing breast shape over time. The best way to tell the options for your breasts would be to visit a plastic surgeon. They would be able to discuss the specific options for you. Best of luck with your breasts. Jeff Rockmore (Dennis Dass, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breasts have sagged after childbirth. Do I need a lift or an augmentation or both?</h3><p>The primary determinant of whether or not an implant may be necessary is whether or not you feel that your breasts are big enough when you are wearing a bra, especially a non-padded sports bra. If you feel your volume is adequate in a non padded bra, then you dont need breast augmentation. Breast lift is associated with new scars on the breast around the nipple and often on the undersurface the breast below the nipple. If the nipple has dropped below the breast fold, these scars are inevitable even if an implant is used in order to lift the nipple into a more attractive position. If the nipple is above the breast fold and you don’t want visible scars on the breast and are prepared or would like to be larger, the volume loss and deflation may be adequately corrected without a breast lift if a suitable implant is selected. (Jeffrey Rockmore, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Lift versus Breast Augmentation?</h3><p>Upon examination, experienced plastic surgeons can tell you definitively whether you will be okay without breast lifting. This examination focuses on the position of the nipple/areolas in relation to the inframammary folds (breast ptosis) and the degree of loose skin (and skin elasticity issues) along the lower poles of the breasts.</p><p>Generally speaking, patients who present with these anatomic findings, do not do well with breast augmentation surgery only. Breast augmentation surgery, on the other hand, is reserved for patients who simply want to increase breast size. Occasionally, patients present with breasts in a “borderline” position where careful positioning of breast implants can create the “illusion” of a minor breast lift.</p><p>Again, careful selection of your plastic surgeon, careful physical examination, and careful communication goals will be some of the keys to success associated with these operations. (Peter J. Capizzi, MD, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Lift versus Breast Augmentation</h3><p>Implants improve the size – lift improves the perkiness. Implant plus lift – can do both. If your nipples point down – you need a lift. If you feel you’re too small and your nipples do not point down – you may benefit from larger implants. (Thomas Trevisani, Sr., MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Augmentation vs Breast Lift or both?</h3><p>If your nipple is near or below your crease then you need a lift. For increased volume you will need an augmentation. If both conditions are present you probably need both. See the below links for more information. (Thomas Trevisani, Sr., MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>This depends on the position of the nipple on the breast mound.</h3><p>The answer to this has to do with the position of the nipple on the breast mound. Generally speaking, if your nipple lies below your breast fold, you would need a breast lift. A breast lift can be done in addition to a breast augmentation if the patient wants to add more volume. (Melek Kayser, MD, Detroit Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Lift versus Breast Augmentation</h3><p>Breast lift alone or in combination with breast augmentation is needed when the breast have dropped, usually after pregnancy, weight loss or just normal aging process. There are different types of lifts available depending on the severity of ptosis (droopiness).</p><p>Implants are added to either increase the size of the breasts or to obtain fullness in the upper breast area that is difficult to obtain with a lift alone. the procedures can be combined but some surgeons prefer to wait for complete healing before adding the implant. (Melek Kayser, MD, Detroit Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast lift and Breast Augmentation serve different purposes</h3><p>A breast lift is used to improve the position of the breast tissue and/or the nipple on the chest wall. This is especially useful either after childbirth or as a woman ages as gravity always wins. The limitation of a breast lift is in the upper part of the breast. In many women, there is not enough tissue in the upper part of the breast to give a full appearance without the assistance of a push up bra.</p><p>This has a tendency to continue after a lift if an implant is not used. The implants role with a lift is to fill the upper half of the breast and give a full appearance without the use of a push up bra. Breast augmentation can, however, be used alone to provide a small amount of lift.</p><p>Usually the way this is accomplished is by putting the implant just below your breast tissue. Saline implants can be very visible and palpable in this location so usually silicone gel implants are preferred. The short answer, however, is to find a board certified plastic surgeon who you like and trust and have him or her examine you. That’s always the best first step. Best of Luck, Dr. Pyle (Michelle J.
