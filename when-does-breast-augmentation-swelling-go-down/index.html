<h3>Swelling After A Breast Augmentation</h3>
<p>Swelling from a breast augmentation varies dependant upon a few things. First, whether the implant is above or below the muscle.</p>
<p>Implants above the muscle have much less swelling. When placed below the muscle, however, injury to the muscle causes the top half of the breast to appear much more swollen.</p>
<p>Second, different people&#8217;s bodies respond differently to surgery. Some swell dramatically and some swell minimally. Third, there are postoperative complications that can cause swelling.</p>
<p>A picture to your plastic surgeon or a quick visit can help you be sure that is not the case.</p>
<div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_134" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 148px"><meta itemprop="width" content="138"><meta itemprop="height" content="200"><img itemprop="url" itemprop="image" class="size-medium wp-image-134" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/After-breast-augmentation-how-long-does-the-swelling-last-picture-138x200.jpg" alt="After breast augmentation how long does the swelling last picture" width="138" height="200" /><p class="wp-caption-text">After breast augmentation how long does the swelling last picture</p></div>
<p>Outside of the last issue, swelling tends to begin to decrease three days after surgery. It continues pretty rapidly over the next ten days and is mostly gone at 3 weeks.</p>
<p>Slight swelling may persist for up to six months and I urge folks to wait at least three months to evaluate what is likely to be very close to their final result. (Jeremy Pyle, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Swelling after breast augmentation</h3>
<p>The swelling after breast augmentation begin to subside gradually in three steps. 4-6 weeks after the surgery subside the 50% of the swelling. The rest until one year but in 6 months the breast look great. (Nodas Kapositas, MD, Greece Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Swelling after breast augmentation</h3>
<div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_132" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 160px"><meta itemprop="width" content="150"><meta itemprop="height" content="200"><img itemprop="url" itemprop="image" class="size-medium wp-image-132" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/After-breast-augmentation-how-long-does-the-swelling-last-image-150x200.jpg" alt="After breast augmentation how long does the swelling last image" width="150" height="200" /><p class="wp-caption-text">After breast augmentation how long does the swelling last image</p></div>
<p>The swelling will subside over a general timeline: 50% in one month, 70% in two months, 80% in 3 months and ~100% in one year. A 325 cc implant will usually make most women increase their cup size by 1 1/2 cups. If you were an A cup before surgery, you should be a small C. Cup size is not scientific and is at the discretion of the designer. If you were a C cup before surgery, you most certainly could be a D cup now. A 325 cc implant will affect a small women differently than a larger women. It also depends on age, weight loss, and child bearing.The bottom line is it is way to early to know you final bra size. Be patient and give it time. (George C. Peck, Jr, MD, West Orange Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Duration of Swelling after Breast Augmentation</h3>
<p>Swelling is not uncommon within a week of breast augmentation surgery. Four months would be a safe time to know your exact bra size, but your swelling may be down in as little as 6 weeks. You will know when the change in size stabilizes. (Michele A. Shermak, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_133" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 201px"><meta itemprop="width" content="191"><meta itemprop="height" content="200"><img itemprop="url" itemprop="image" class="size-medium wp-image-133" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/After-breast-augmentation-how-long-does-the-swelling-last-photo-191x200.jpg" alt="After breast augmentation how long does the swelling last photo" width="191" height="200" /><p class="wp-caption-text">After breast augmentation how long does the swelling last photo</p></div>
<h3>How long does swelling last after breast augmentation</h3>
<p>After most surgeries there is an natural body reaction to swell in the operated area. This includes breast augmentation. Maximal swelling usually happens about 48 hours after the surgery.</p>
<p>Over the next 2-6 weeks, that swelling subsides in the tissues of the breast and chest as well as resolution of air and fluid in the implant pocket.It may take additional 3-6 months for a minor residual swelling to reduce to the final shape and size. During this time the implants usually drop giving the breast a subjective appearance of shrinking as well. (Scott Haupt, MD, Salt Lake City Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>postoperative swelling</h3>
<div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_135" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 104px"><meta itemprop="width" content="94"><meta itemprop="height" content="200"><img itemprop="url" itemprop="image" class="size-medium wp-image-135" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/After-breast-augmentation-surgery-how-long-does-the-swelling-last-94x200.jpg" alt="After breast augmentation surgery how long does the swelling last" width="94" height="200" /><p class="wp-caption-text">After breast augmentation surgery how long does the swelling last</p></div>
<p>Swelling is normal in all breast augmentation patients. The amount swelling and the duration of swelling varies based on technique, the individual patient, and other factors such as general health, Postoperative exercise, and breast size.</p>
<p>Most patients experience a dramatic decrease in swelling over the first month which persists. Around postoperative week number six some patients have a small amount of swelling increased as the body&#8217;s healing cycle begins to reach its peak. By 12 weeks postop most all swelling has subsided. (Christopher Khorsandi, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>When Does Swelling After Breast Augmentation Begin to Subside?</h3>
<p>Everyone is different. At 5 days you will still have swelling (edema) and can&#8217;t judge your final size. Look for improvement, or reduction in the swelling starting around 2 weeks out and wait until about 6 weeks out before you really get to see your more permanent volume. (Garrett A. Wirth, MD, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Breast Swelling Following Surgery: Gradual Improvement After a Week</h3>
<div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_131" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 160px"><meta itemprop="width" content="150"><meta itemprop="height" content="200"><img itemprop="url" itemprop="image" class="size-medium wp-image-131" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/After-breast-aug-how-long-does-the-swelling-last-150x200.jpg" alt="After breast aug how long does the swelling last" width="150" height="200" /><p class="wp-caption-text">After breast aug how long does the swelling last</p></div>
<p>All patients swell to some degree after breast augmentation. I find that within about 5 to 7 days, the majority of patients note that swelling decreases. By one week, swelling between the breasts reduces and the shape of the breasts become more defined. There is quite a variation in how much swelling occurs.</p>
<p>Surgeons with good technique on average create less swelling. Some patients are prone to swelling more than others, but the use of ice, elevation, and rest helps quite a bit. Most of my patients look great and can purchase new bras by 3 weeks after surgery. Very few of these patients find that their breasts lose much volume after 3 to 4 weeks. For most patients, a good expectation of long-term volume results are present by 4 &#8211; 6 weeks. (Stephen Bresnick, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>5 days post op from breast augmentation surgery is too soon to tell what your final result will be. I have my patients sleep in an upright position for 4 weeks. Also, your swelling drains through the lymphatic system which flows down the inside of your arms.</p>
<p>When you are sleeping or sitting place pillows under your arms to elevate the arms. Make sure not to elevate too high…you don&#8217;t want to be horizontal to your shoulders or above the shoulders. Please follow your post op instructions and do not over do. (Christine Rodgers, MD, Denver Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Swelling After Breast Augmentation Improves By Three Weeks, Almost All Gone by Three Months</h3>
<p>After your breast augmentation the swelling increases for the first 4 days and peaks on the 5th day and will add about 20% to the overall size. On the 5th day you will usually notice there is a definite upper breast fullness and the breasts will feel firm. The pectoralis muscle may also be in spasm pushing the implants up like a push-up bra. Most patients will ask about whether all of this is normal. I tell them the following timeline3 weeks &#8211; I let them know that by 3 weeks about 80% of the swelling goes away and the implants will begin to soften and drop down in the pocket slightly3 months &#8211; by 3 months 90% of the swelling is gone and the implants are much softer.</p>
<p>They also have usually moved down to a more normal position. This is a good time to evaluate the result. By this time they are nearly their final size. It is OK to buy bras that fit your new breasts.6 months &#8211; All swelling is gone and the implants are in their final position.</p>
<p>They may be slightly smaller than at 3 months but it can be hard to recognize without photos because the change is smallRemember that making judgements before 2-3 months is difficult because the result is not complete. I will usually see patients 2-3 months after surgery to make sure they are happy with the final result. (David L. Mobley, MD, FACS, Sarasota Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Cup size depends on the brand</h3>
<p>At one to two weeks most of the swelling will have subsided and you should get a pretty good idea of your size. I tell my patients to go bra shopping after one month. Keep in mind that cup size is dependent on band size and brand.</p>
<p>A D cup at Victoria&#8217;s Secret may be a C cup at Nordstrom. If the size on the tag is important to you shop around to find a C cup that fits your new breasts (but not until you are 3-4 weeks out from surgery). (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Post operative swelling</h3>
<p>You will definitely still have swelling at 5 days post operative, most will subside by 3-6 weeks but some the final swelling can take 3-6 months to completely go away.</p>
<p>It is entirely too early to try and evaluate your results at this time, try and be patient, it will be about 3-6 months before you will be able to appreciate your final results. (Luis H. Macias, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Breast swelling</h3>
<p>Breast swelling begins to subside approximately one week following surgery, but it will take at least six months to see your final result. (David Stoker, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Breast Augmentation Swelling</h3>
<p>So Breast Augmentation recovery goes through some predictable stages. Initially the breasts are tight, swollen and painful. Over the next 6 weeks the is a significant amount of settling. By 3 months I would say 90% of the swelling has resolved and the breast are soft.</p>
<p>Of course everything has to do with your anatomy and what size implant you select but this is a rough guideline. (Rady Rahban, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Answer swelling about breast augmentation.</h3>
<p>It is normal for the breasts swell after breast augmentation, the breast augmentation swelling begins to decrease after two weeks of the operation and the final size of your breasts will notice the two months after surgery. (Manuel Marte, MD, Dominican Republic Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Swelling post breast augmentation</h3>
<p>Typically, the swelling can take 6 to 8 weeks to subside. In some cases it can begin to subside in as little as 2 to 3 weeks, but the majority of the swelling you&#8217;re experiencing will take about 2 months to subside. (Leonard A. Roudner, MD, FACS, Coral Gables Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Swelling after augmentation</h3>
<p>The swelling will take a few months to go down, try to be patient and I wouldn&#8217;t invest in a few bras until you reach the 2-3 month mark. (Mahlon Kerr, MD, FACS, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Swelling after Breast Implants</h3>
<p>You are only 5 days out from your surgery. You will have swelling for at least a month after your surgery. You will continue to see changes in your breasts for 3-4 months after surgery. The superior pole swelling (top of breast) will begin to subside and your breast implants will begin to settle into their position on your chest.</p>
<p>I do not recommend spending a lot of money on bras until 3-4 months after surgery when your breasts have assumed their final position. Be patient, give yourself time to recover and heal. Swelling is normal after any surgery. (Christopher J. Morea, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Emotional roller coaster is normal after breast augmentaion</h3>
<p>In regards to size after breast augmentation, it is not unlikely to experience an emotional roller coaster. Due to the initial swelling, the implants sit high and can appear larger than they really are. This may take a month or two to settle down.</p>
<p>May women get upset, thinking the size chosen was too large. During the time it takes the implant to settle, many women get used to this larger appearing chest and find themselves again questioning the size choice once they settle.</p>
<p>After another month or so of living with the implants in their final resting position, many women find themselves happy again with the size. So, be patient and be aware that this roller coaster you may experience is normal and expected. (Michael Burgdorf, MD, Nashville Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>Swelling after breast augmentation usually can subside after a week &#8211; provided there is no internal bleeding or hematoma. However, general swelling can last for weeks. Swelling is a normal response to all surgical procedures.</p>
<p>Every person has a different timeframe for the resolution. In general, after 6 months- it should be complete. (Thomas Trevisani, Sr., MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>Generally, the first couple weeks post-op, you will experience some swelling and bruising. It can take anywhere between 3-6 months for patients to see the end result of a breast augmentation.</p>
<p>Once the implants have dropped, settled in and swelling is completely gone, you will see the final results of your new breasts. (Orlando Llorente, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>No worries, at 5 day you are still swollen after breast augmentation. The implants will also sit high on the chest and this can make the breasts appear larger.</p>
<p>The swelling should be starting to resolve and will take 4 to 6 weeks for most of the swelling to go away. (Lisa M. DiFrancesco, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Swelling after breast augmention</h3>
<p>Most of the swelling after breast augmentation should subside within the first 2-6 weeks, while the last bit may linger for even 3-6 months. (Samir S. Rao, MD, Chevy Chase Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Breast Swelling, Size and Shape after Augmentation</h3>
<p>I refer to bra cup size as a concept, and I do not feel it is possible to fully predict postoperative bra size. At two weeks out from surgery, it is very early in the maturation of the shape of the breast and I would expect changes to be seen in the shape and bra-fit from settling of the implant position, breast tissue accommodation and reduction of swelling.</p>
<p>I use 3D simulation for breast augmentation, and it is very good for demonstrating volume change. Work with your surgeon in the postoperative process and ask for their opinion on how the above factors are anticipated to change for you over time. (Nick Slenkovich, MD, Denver Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Swelling after breast augmentation and bra cup size</h3>
<p>You may be fitting into a D bra because of swelling, or it may be the bra itself. Cup sizes are not standardized among different bra manufacturers. It is certainly possible that if you shop for a bra elsewhere, you could be a C or even a DD.</p>
<p>For this reason, I always counsel my patients not to worry about size of the bra, but how they look in the mirror and in clothes. Having said that, at 5 days post surgery, there probably is at least some swelling that you can expect to resolve over the next few weeks. (Jonathan C. Weinrach, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Post breast augmentation swelling</h3>
<p>There are actually two issues here. There is always at least a little swelling following most surgical procedures. Most of this swelling disappears during the first week or two. But there is also perceived swelling that is actually more related to the position of the implants.</p>
<p>This fullness at the tops of the breasts seems like swelling but is related to the tightness around the implants. As your tissues relax, the look becomes more natural and looks less swollen. (Richard L. Zeff, MD, Portsmouth Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Breast size 5 days after augmentation</h3>
<p>Without pre/postop photos, would be difficult to tell. However, 5 days after surgery is way too early to determine your final cup size.Allow time for the swelling to decrease and for the implants to &#8220;drop&#8221;. You should have your final size in 3-6 months (Michael Orseck, MD, Greenville Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Breast Augmentation swelling resolves in 6 weeks</h3>
<p>Most swelling has subsided by 6 weeks, at which time you will see your true cup size. In some patients it may take longer and if placed under the muscle can take some time to relax and settle into a natural appearing breast. (Adam C. Augenstein, MD, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Swelling After Breast Augmentation Takes Time to Subside</h3>
<p>After breast augmentation, it is common to swell up to 20% more than the actual size your breasts will end up at. The swelling maxes out around the first 3-5 days. By 1 week there is significantly less swelling. However, we don&#8217;t recommend sizing until 3-4 weeks after the procedure. By this point a majority of the swelling is gone and you should be safe buying a couple of new bras. By 3 months, the swelling should be gone and a full new wardrobe may be considered to accentuate your new look. (Kent V. Hasen, MD, Naples Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Post-op swelling</h3>
<p>At 5 days post-op, you are still near the peak of your swelling. So, don&#8217;t judge the breast size and shape at this time. It will take 3-4 weeks for the swelling to settle. Wait until about 1 month out before going bra shopping. It will take about 2-3 months for the tissues to relax, and for the implants to &#8220;settle in&#8221;, before you see the final result. Hang in there! (Thomas Fiala, MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Swelling after breast augmentation</h3>
<p>Swelling after breast augmentation is normal and will resolve in 6-8 weeks. If swelling persists, there could be a seroma or hematoma. You should consult with your plastic surgeon if you feel that the breasts are abnormally swollen after 2 months. I would wait 3 months before shopping for new bras. (David S. Chang, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Breast swelling</h3>
<p>I usually tell my patients to wait at least 2 months before buying new bras. Until then I like them to wear nonunderwire supportive sports bras. (Michael Ian Rose, MD, Frisco Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>My experience is with breast implants placed under the muscle, which is the only way I perform breast augmentation. Breast augmentation swelling peaks at 4-7 days. In 2-3 months the swelling has nearly resolved and the breast implants have settled into their pockets. Implants can be placed under the muscle through a small incision under the breast, transaxillary, or in a dual plane technique for a small lift. Each approach is tailored to the patient&#8217;s body characteristics.  (Jason Mussman, MD, )</p>
<h3>Swelling after Breast Augmentation</h3>
<p>Swelling is normal during the first few months following breast augmentation surgery. After the first two weeks have past swelling will begin to subside and then after about 9 months the “final” result will appear. Then you will be able to determine your exact bra size. (Jaime Perez, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Breast swelling after augmentation can take weeks to resolve</h3>
<p>Swelling of breast tissues, especially after a dual-plane breast augmentation, is common. It may take a few weeks for this tissue swelling to resolve, and you may see some loss on volume after swelling has resolved. (Scott C. Sattler, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>When does swelling after breast augmentation subside?</h3>
<p>Since you are only 5 days from your augmentation, I would suspect that you have an extensive amount of swelling at this time. I find that most of the swelling occurs in the upper part of the breast, especially if you have had a subpectoral augmentation. This swelling should resolve over the next 5-6 weeks. At that time, you should have a better idea of your final breast size. (Robert Najera, MD, Phoenix Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Give It At Least 3 Weeks</h3>
<p>Swelling is usually at its maximum point at 48 to 72 hour after any surgical procedure. It then starts to subside, and the rate at which it decreases is depends on the patient. You will see a noticeable decrease in a swelling over the first 3 weeks. After that time your breast shape will continue to change and will become more natural — the upper pole will decrease and the lower aspect will become rounder. You should have a much better idea of the ultimate size of your breasts after 3 weeks. (Louis C. Cutolo, Jr., MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>You cannot figure out your size right now. There is a lot of swelling for 2 weeks after surgery and then there is a little bit of swelling for 3 months. I usually have my patients go bra shopping after 6 weeks. You may fill out a D at Victoria&#8217;s Secret and that may correlate with a C at Macy&#8217;s. Bra makers are not uniform so don&#8217;t put too much weight in &#8220;bra size&#8221; &#8211; especially if you really like what you look like! (K. Roxanne Grawe, MD, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Swelling subsiding after breast augmentation</h3>
<p>Swelling after breast augmentation usually begins to subside after 2 weeks. However, the final position and appearance of the breasts may not be apparent for typically 3-6 months (John Zavell, MD, FACS, Toledo Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>When does swelling after breast augmentation go away?</h3>
<p>It is very common to be about a size bigger right after surgery than what your final result will be. Swelling starts to occur right after surgery and tends to peak in the first week. After about a month you will have lost most of the swelling, but still not completely at baseline. After about another 3 months or so, you will have lost 99% of your swelling, but still you have a pretty good idea at 1 month.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t spend a lot of money on bras until 3 months as they might not fit perfectly after all the swelling goes away. Also, the more activity you have, the longer the swelling stays, the more that needs to be done as far as lift etc. with surgery, the longer your swelling stays. (Pablo Prichard, MD, Phoenix Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Typically Swelling Improves After 3 Months</h3>
<p>Typically all the swelling is gone 3 months after surgery. Initially after 1 month the majority of the swelling has dissipated. (David L. Robbins, MD, FACS, West Des Moines Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Swelling Takes Weeks to Resolve</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s totally normal for you to be swollen just 5 days after your surgery. I tell my breast augmentation patients that most of their swelling should be gone about 6 weeks after surgery, and the breasts will actually continue to change a bit for months after that as the tissues soften and stretch and the implants &#8220;settle.&#8221;</p>
<p>At about 6 weeks, though, you should be able to try on bras and get a good idea of what your final results will look like. Don&#8217;t hesitate to reach out to your surgeon if you have questions during this time.  (Arthur M. Cambeiro, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>Do not worry. Early <strong>swelling after breast augmentation</strong> resolves quickly in the first few weeks. As the body heals over the next 6 weeks, final swelling (last 15-20%) takes months.</p>
<p>The tissues have to relax to accommodate the additional volume. Sounds like your surgeon did a beautiful job, if this is your only issue. Relax and enjoy, you made a good decision. (William C. Rigano, MD, Dayton Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p><em>Swelling after breast augmentation</em> tends to peak around three days and then begins to slowly subside.</p>
<p>While the majority of swelling will be gone in the first few weeks, it may take several months to resolve completely. (Earl E. Ferguson III, MD, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>The swelling from a breast augmentation can dramatically reduce after only a few days but will continue to improve for weeks. When you use a supportive bra and massage as directed it will speed your recovery and improve your results. (Frank J. Ferraro, MD, Paramus Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Swelling After Breast Augmentation</h3>
<p>Swelling after breast augmentation starts to subside after the second week, of course so long as the patient follows the indications given after surgery, it is important to avoid heavy lifting and any excessive use of arms within the frist month especially, by following indications properly you will have a fast recovery and a great outcome, final results aren&#8217;t complete until the sixth month. (Luis Suarez, MD, Mexico Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Swelling after breast aug</h3>
<p>You are very early in the healing process. It is common to have some swelling after surgery. It is also expected for your breasts to feel tight.</p>
<p>With time the swelling is going to subside but more importantly the breast is going to get used to its new size and begin to relax and soften and the implant is going to settle into place. These changes are going to occur over the next 2-3 months and around three months you are going to have your &#8220;result.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t spend alot of money on bras now as your breasts are going to change. Your bra size can differ a little depending on the brand or store you buy your bras from as it seems no two bras are the same.  (Vanessa Voge, MD, Wichita Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>Swelling after breast augmentation is typically worse in the first week after surgery and gradually resolves over the following 4-6 weeks. Each individual, however, heals differently.</p>
<p>You can expect a 10-15% reduction in the immediate size after surgery but generally not more than that. If you are fitting into a D bra 5 days after surgery you may end up with a full C cup in a few weeks. (Mohammed Alghoul, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Swelling after breast augmentation surgery</h3>
<p>Many patients fail to understand that the body is adjusting to an alien object within it. It is perfectly normal to experience swelling anywhere from 3 weeks to 9 weeks, depending on the body and how well the person recovers. The swelling should go down within the next 3-4 weeks substantially, but always keep in mind that your breasts will probably lose some dimension once the swelling lessens.</p>
<p>It is hard to know exactly what size bra you will wear until about 6-8 months post operative. I say 6-8 months because by then, your implants have settled and dropped, and your body has gotten used to the implant that was placed. (Jonathan Fisher, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>When Does Swelling After Breast Augmentation Begin to Subside?</h3>
<p>After a breast augmentation there is always some degree of swelling that is related to the surgery. The swelling is caused by a small amount of fluid around the breast implant as well as part of a natural response to surgery. The swelling will improve of a period of 3 to 6 weeks. The size the breast will decrease as this swelling subsides. How much it decreases in size will be related to the amount of swelling that occurs after surgery (this varies from patient to patient).</p>
<p>Then over a period of 3 to 6 months the implant will settle in the breast pocket. The process of the implant &#8220;dropping&#8221; occurs as the weight of the implant stretches the surrounding tissue. The degree to which the implant moves depends on several factors including the size of the implant, the position (under or over the muscle), and the strength of the surrounding tissue. The overall feel of the implant usually softens and the fill of the upper pole of the breast decreases. (David Mathes, MD, Aurora Plastic Surgeon)</p>
