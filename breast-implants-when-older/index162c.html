However, at an older age, you may need an uplift which can be done at the same time. (Edward J. Domanskis, MD, Newport Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>As long as you are healthy and doing an augment for the right reasons, go for it!</p><p>I have many patients both older and younger than you! SJR (Stephen J. Ronan, MD, FACS, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Oh, I think “Nuts” is being a little hard on yourself. Actually, of course, there are no specific age limits to elective surgical procedures, both in general and specifically for this.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4200" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>You need to be in good medical shape (for this or other procedures) and then you have to understand what’s good and bad about the surgery. That includes the risks of the surgery.</p><p>But if you’re in good medical health there’s no reason not to consider this. 60 is the new 50, or 40, or something like that! People are living longer and in better health than ever.</p><p>If it’s something you want, you should not be deterred by your chronological age. (Alan M. Engler, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast augmentation at age 60</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4202" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-098a335066c2c0ecb39ed88f1bb7ca70">

</div><p>There is no specific age limit for breast augmentation. It’s important that you be in good overall medical health and have an updated mammogram before having the surgery. You should have medical clearance by your primary care physician prior to the surgery (EKG, labs, etc.) A board certified plastic surgeon can review your medical history and determine if this is a safe procedure for you- regardless of age. (William Bruno, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Too old for breast augmentation?</h3><p>There is no such thing as too old for breast augmentation. A number of my patients have appreciated being able to recapture lost breast volume and go braless. A fairly consistent effect of age is loss of skin tone, so most older patients do best with a modest increase in size that doesn’t stretch the tissue, or place too much weight on the supportive structures. It’s important to review your health history, as some health factors, such as heart disease or wound healing problems may make you a less appropriate candidate. (Karen Vaniver, MD, Kennewick Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4201" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>There is no age limit to breast augmentation. Modern medicine, and plastic surgery in particular, is about adding life to your years and not just years to your life. So, if you are medically fit and have an appropriate body shape that is likely to benefit from breast augmentation, go for it! In fact, one of my patients who was in her early 60’s joked with me, “I am going to pay for my breast augmentation with my first social security check!” (Navin K. Singh, MD, Washington DC Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>As long as you are healthy there is no contraindications to augmentation. HOWEVER, the risks are much higher in my experience because the thin tissues don’t hold the implants in place as well as in a young person. I have done many over 50 and the issues they have after are far more common than in the under 50’s. So, GO SMALL, use gel under the muscle and keep your expectations conservative and reasonable. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4203" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>No you are not nuts! You are in the prime of you life! As long as you are healthy, I see no reason why you should not get an augmentation.</p><p>Be prepared, your surgeon will likely also recommend a mastopexy in addition to the augmentation.</p><p>You mention that you r thin, so it may be that you do not need a lift also, but not many 60 year old women have the breast shape and skin elasticity for an augmentation alone. (Gordon Lewis, MD, Richmond Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Breast implants is a great way to improve your self confidence and love the way you look in clothes and swimwear – at any age!</p><p>The procedure is an outpatient procedure meaning you go home the same day. The pain is worst for the first 3 – 5 days and then there is about two weeks of mild soreness.</p><p>You will also need to wear a support bra for six weeks. That’s it! Before you know it, you will be a whole new person with more confidence and better self image. (Bivik Rajnikant Shah, MD, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>As technology allows us improved opportunities for youthful appearances as we age, your general health is the key factor to determine your ability to tolerate surgical trauma as the decades go by.</p><p>Aesthetic surgery may be considered just one part of an essential program to optimize your quality of life. It’s not about vanity, but being at the top of your game, isn’t it? (Randy Wong, MD, Honolulu Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast implants at 60</h3><p>Are you crazy? Absolutely not! Assuming you are healthy and have reasonable expectations. Go for it! (Jonathan Saunders, MD, Newark Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Your age doesn’t preclude you from having a breast implants. If you are in good health you certainly could consider the procedure. Prior to your surgery you should have a breast exam and consider having a mammogram. Your surgeon should evaluate your breasts for sagging or ptosis, as a breast lift may also be needed. I have had a significant number of patients over the age of 60, who have had breast implants and have been pleased with the results. (Vincent D. Lepore, MD, San Jose Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Having very successfully performed augmentation mamoplasty on a great number of 70+ year olds, I feel 60 is a young age. As others have said you need to be in good health but so many of us are much healthier and feel younger now that folks did in the past. If you feel good and are healthy it is also good to have a great body image which implants could do for you. The last 70 year oil I performed augmentation mamoplasty on was 76 and went on later to have a face lift, brow lift and eye lid surgery. The only thing I would ask you to make sure of is that you have an experienced Board Certified Plastic Surgeon with who you are comfortable with do your surgery. Enjoy the new you. (Carl W. Rick Lentz III, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>As long as you have no major health conditions and your Medical Doctor thinks you are medically stable for surgery, then there is no reason for you not to move forward if you are motivated (Michael A. Fiorillo, MD, Walnut Creek Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Sexagenarian Breast implants</h3><p>In the US, 24,491 women aged 51-64 had breast augmentation in 2010, accounting for 7.7% of all breast implants surgery. If you are fit and healthy, the procedure can be safely performed. Be certain to seek an experienced, Board Certified Plastic Surgeon in your area. They may also recommend a visit to your primary care doctor for a routine physical examination. (Joseph Mele, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breat augmentation is fine at age 60</h3><p>There has been a shift and blurring of the age at which any cosmetic procedure might seem ‘acceptable’ and many today live a life quite different than age would indicate. After all age is only a number and for the lucky ones life at 60 can seem like life at 40.</p><p>There is no reason why breast implants cannot be considered at any age, and if it suits your goals and lifestyle you can do it. (Peter E. Johnson, MD, Barrington Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It is certainly acceptable to have your first breast implants after the age of 60. As long as you are healthy without major medical problems, then you should be fine to proceed. (Christopher V. Pelletiere, MD, Saint George Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast implants does not have an Age Limit</h3><p>Certainly you are not nuts for thinking about breast implants nor are you nuts for doing a breast augmentation. Breast augmentation is a form of breast reconstruction and no one thinks twice about a woman doing breast implants following surgery for breast cancer.</p><p>You have had a natural loss of breast size and shape so it is natural to want to look young again and restore yourself. (Marcus L. Peterson, MD)</p><h3>Breast implants at age 60</h3><p>The cosmetic issues and suitability concerns are really no different because of age. The main difference is that the risk of breast cancer increases significantly in older women and although breast implants has nothing to do with this risk, the needs for tests and possible treatment go up and this should be taken into consideration when considering a cosmetic procedure on the breasts. The other issue is that it’s more likely that a mastopexy (lift) procedure will be needed, but this is not assessed differently than younger women. (Scott L. Replogle, MD, Denver Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>As a practicing plastic surgeon in Scottsdale for 24 years, I have performed many primary (first) breast implants in women in their 50’s, 60’s and believe it or not, even into their 70’s – so your question and request is absolutely normal and reasonable. Furthermore, most of the women that I see in their 60’s and 70’s who already have breast implants and need to either have them removed or replaced due to rupture, elect to have them replaced.</p><p>They do not want to go around without having breasts. From the information that you provided, it appears that a breast implants would be a very reasonable consideration which could be further confirmed by a consultation. (Steven Turkeltaub, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast implants at 60</h3><p>You are not “nuts” to think about breast surgery as long as your health is good and the plastic surgeon that cares for you feels as though you are a good candidate. I would recommend finding one or more board-certified plastic surgeons to meet with and to get their opinions. Take your written down questions with you so as to get as much as possible out of your consultation. (Michael C. Edwards, MD, FACS, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast implants</h3><p>As long as you are healthy (you will need medical clearance) and your expectations are reasonable, there is typically no reason for you not to have BA.</p><p>I have seen many BA candidates in their 50s and 60s who are excellent candidates for this procedure given their medical history. (Edward J. Bednar, MD, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
