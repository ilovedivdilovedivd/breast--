(Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Sports bra after Breast Augmentation</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1486" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I find that the majority of my patients benefit from a surgical bra in the immediate recovery period. In cases of breast asymmetry correction or a breast augmentation with lift, I think a bra is mandatory to ensure that the implants stays in the position I put them.</p><p>In primary breast augmentation cases, I also recommend a surgical bra in patients who are physically active and have implants placed under the muscle. I worry that strong pectoralis muscle contractions can displace the implant from its surgical pocket. (Paul S. Gill, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>My patients are always put in a sports bra at the time of surgery for a few reasons. I want to put them in a bra that properly fits them and is not displacing my new implants but gently supporting.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1483" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Otherwise, a patient may go to Victoria Secret and get a push-up bra. Also, I feel the support makes recovery more comfortable. After one month, they can wear a regular wire bra (Joshua B. Hyman, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Surgical Bra Post Surgery</h3><p>A surgical bra is not necessary for a good result after surgery. It is surgeons preference whether or not to use a bra post surgery. Most of the time with breast augmentation I use an ace bandage to hold breasts in place and reduce swelling on the upper part of the breast. Again, this is surgeon’s preference. (Jaime Perez, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Surgical Bra Following Surgery</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1484" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I do not place surgical bras on my patients following breast surgery. All implants ride high initially due to swelling in the lower portion of the breast. Implants descend as the swelling abates. If patients desire some support or coverage, I recommend that they use a sports bra for a few weeks. Having tried many, I find surgical bras to fit poorly and offer little other than a means to secure gauze without tape.</p><p>I prefer to cover my wounds with surgical glue and simplify matters. This way, patients can shower right away. I use straps and Bandeaus only in rare situations when implants persistently ride high. I would adhere to whatever regimen your surgeon suggests as it likely works well for him or her. (Brian M. Braithwaite, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Wearing a Sports Bra after Surgery-Follow your doctors advice</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1485" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>In the majority of patients having Breast augmentation the use of a bra after surgery likely makes no difference in the long term result. I will often give patients a choice. Some patients will feel more comfortable with the support of a post-surgical bra. (John E. Gross, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>There are mixed opinions on bra use after surgery</h3><p>Many plastic surgeons feel strongly that a tight, supportive post-op bra is essential after breast augmentation, while an equal number suggest a loose bra (or no bra at all) is better and more comfortable for the patient. Since we have no objective studies that indicate whether one option might be better, it’s best to follow your surgeon’s recommendation.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1487" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-c7b3e0b9854ed013c1592278f6f706f4">

</div><p>Keep in mind that he or she is basing this suggestion based on years of professional knowledge and expertise in performing breast augmentation surgery, and has well thought-out reasons behind this advice. (Nirav Savalia, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Sports Bra After Breast Augmentation Surgery</h3><p>I give all of my patients a non-underwire loose cotton sports bra after their breast augmentation surgery. This is purely for comfort and provides no medical benefit. You do not need to wear a sports bra after the surgery (except in specific cases that your doctor should instruct you on).</p><p>If you have an incision placed underneath the breast and choose to wear a bra, I do recommend that you avoid underwires for at least 6 weeks. Good luck! (Sacha Obaid, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You can wear a surgical bra after breast augmentation if you want, but I find it unnecessary. You should ask why your surgeon advised you to not wear a bra. (Michael Constantin Gartner, DO, Paramus Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Should I Wear Surgical Bra After Breast Augmentation?</h3><p>There are different schools of thought when it comes to post-surgical bras after breast augmentation. I believe almost all surgeons will agree that it is wise to wear a surgical bra for at least a few days after surgery.</p><p>It provides support, prevents too much movement of the implants and helps to hold dressings in place.</p><p>This will decrease tenderness, inflammation and tension on the healing breasts. My patients wear a soft surgical bra for one week, then transition to a specialty surgical bra that provides significant support for another 3-4 weeks.</p><p>They can then transition to a soft supportive bra of their choice or continue the surgical support bra if they desire. After 6-8 weeks, patients may wear whatever bra they desire. (Gary Motykie, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Surgical bra after breast implants or breast augmentation</h3><p>It is advised to follow your specific surgeons instructions. Every doctor has a slightly different approach to surgery and therefore post-op and recovery instructions vary. I do not recommend the use of a bra for my patients unless some sort of lifting via masto-pexy, use of strattice for an internal bra, or raising the inframammary fold via suturing is performed.</p><p>I instruct them to wear a cami or bralette to allow for the implants to drop in the pocket created. The support from a compression or sports bra may prohibit this and cause the implants to sit too high. (Alan N. Larsen, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Surgical bra after breast augmentation</h3><p>It is best to wear a light compression garment for the first 2-3 days. It helps with swelling to a degree, but it is really for comfort. There is nothing specific to any garment that is going to affect your final outcome. It is nice to be snugged gently in a comfortable sports bra or ace wrap. (Gregory Diehl, MD, FACS, Long Island Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Surgical bra after breast augmentation</h3><p>Every surgeon has his or her own protocol for recovery after breast augmentation. It is perfectly acceptable to not wear a surgical bra post-operatively. At the same time, many surgeons do recommend a surgical bra. Discuss your concerns with your surgeon. You are likely to do fine either way. (Lara Devgan, MD, MPH, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Surgical bra usage after breast augmentation</h3><p>Some plastic surgeons recommend using a surgical bra, some do not. Both sides have their reasons, but unfortunately there is no hard data to support one method over another. I typically recommend patients simply follow the recommendations of the surgeon they’ve chosen – presumably you’ve done the research and trust him or her with your surgery, you should also trust their post-op protocol. (Bryan Correa, MD, The Woodlands Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Surgical Bra After Breast Augmentation</h3><p>Each surgeon has his or her guidelines for postoperative care. Your surgeon knows the scope of the surgery and the specifics about you so if there is clarity in communication then you should feel comfortable following his or her instruction. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Surgical Bra After Breast Augmentation?</h3><p>The decision to instruct a woman to wear a surgical bra after implants may be based on a number of factors. Although some surgeons feel it is appropriate to always wear a bra immediately after, others feel the opposite and all have good reasons.</p><p>In my practice some do and some don’t. Often the decision is based on ones anatomy – for example if one has very tight skin and breast tissue – not wearing a bra may help the breasts settle faster. On the other hand if one has looser skin and supporting structures, a bra may be indicated to help stabilize a pocket. It is always fair to ask your surgeon the rational for a bra or any other aspect of your care – Im sure he or she will be happy to answer. (George Volpe, MD, Boston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast augmentation and baking cakes</h3><p>Doing surgery or practicing medicine, is a little arts and craftsy or like baking a cake. Different surgeons have different routines and practices.</p><p>I prefer a surgical bra (for my patients:) but don’t think its necessarily absolutely something that would be required by every surgeon.</p><p>Ask your doctor why or why not if you want to know – there is usually a reason. Good luck! (Matthew H. Conrad, MD, Wichita Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Post operative support bra</h3><p>I recommend that patients avoid wearing an underwire bra for the first 6 weeks following breast implant surgery. The reason for this is that underwire can prevent the descent of the implants and lead to high final implant positioning.</p><p>Also if you have an incision under the breast (inframammary) then the underwire can irritate the incision.</p><p>You can wear a soft bra, a sports bra, or go bra-less. But speak to your surgeon and discuss what his or her preferred choice is. (Christopher Khorsandi, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>What type of support bra should I wear after surgery?</h3><p>There are different schools of thought on this. I personally select a bra for my patients to wear immediately post surgery that holds the breasts/implants exactly where I want them to be. I feel this get me a very good reproducible result and am very finicky about my patient’s post operative care.</p><p>There can be slight areas of weakness in the pocket created to place the implant, and until the pocket heals internally, there is a risk I have seen of getting a little assymetrical if this is not done. I have seen this in some patients who see me to get assymetry corrected. Some surgeons do not believe in this. But I think what you do after surgery is just as important as what you do during surgery. (Pablo Prichard, MD, Phoenix Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Surgical Bra Need</h3><p>A surgical bra is generally provided for the patient. You can either choose to continue wearing the provided bra or switch to a supportive bra without an underwire which can be worn 4-6 weeks after surgery. (David L. Robbins, MD, FACS, West Des Moines Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Bra after breast augmention</h3><p>There is no universal dressing after a breast augmentation. Some surgeons use Ace wraps, some use bras, some use straps, some use nothing. There is no substantiated data in plastic surgery to support the use of one dressing over another.</p><p>If you trusted your surgeon to perform your surgery, have good faith in his post-operative protocols. (Samir S. Rao, MD, Chevy Chase Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Wearing a support bra after breast augmentation</h3><p>There is nothing to worry about. Some surgeons use bras after the operation and others do not. It is a personal preference of the surgeon and there is no good evidence to suggest one way or the other. That being said, I would respect your surgeon’s opinion and follow their post-op regimen.</p><p>If you are asked to wear a bra and are not provided with a garment, make sure to avoid underwires as they may place undo pressure over the incision, in an areas where you may have some reduced sensation. (Kunaal Jindal, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Support bra after surgery</h3><p>If you have a tight lower pole and want to encourage the implants to “drop”, I frequently have my patients go braless, or wear a strap across the upper pole of the breasts to encourage the implants to help round out the lower part of the breast. Not all patients in my practice get a support bra post-op. (Michael Orseck, MD, Greenville Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Postoperative support bra Use after Breast Augmentation</h3><p>Surgeons vary in their preference for a postop bra after surgery, and there is no one “right” answer. My basic approach to Bra use after Breast Augmentation is based on each person’s tissues and progress in the healing period:</p><p>When I use a bra, it is placed in the operation room. If the Support bra is uncomfortable, discontinue it or change bras. Commonly we discontinue bra use when we want to encourage settling of the breast and implant.</p><p>Often we will use an elastic band for 1-2 weeks that is worn above the breasts to add gentle downward pressure In addition, for many years I have had all of our postoperative patients see our massage therapist after surgery, occasionally adding extra visits when needed to get more mobilization of the tissues.</p><p>The benefits of postoperative tissue-directed massage therapy and education are numerous, to the point now that I can’t imagine not having it as an integral part of the recovery process in my practice. (Nick Slenkovich, MD, Denver Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Post Operative Support Bra</h3><p>There are conflicting opinions among surgeons regarding post operative support. I prefer a mild compression band across the tops of the breast for a week, but I do not feel so strongly that I disagree with other approaches.</p><p>I suggest that, if you are confident in your surgeon for other reasons, you should trust your surgeon with this decision. (Richard L. Zeff, MD, Portsmouth Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
