</div><p>That is why the hormone creams etc do not work on someone who naturally have smaller breasts because they are less sensative to hormones.</p><p>In addition, the breast is also composed of fat tissue which grows and shrinks with weight gain and loss. So there is no simple answer here. (Pablo Prichard, MD, Phoenix Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Size of breast</h3><p>Most women are through developing from puberty around 15-16 years of age, but a few will continue until about 20-21. Unless you become pregnant or gain weight, your breasts may not change in size for quite some time. You might want to see a board certified plastic surgeon and discuss augmentation options. (Connie Hiers, MD, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast development</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2719" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Even if you look 16, your breasts have probably reached maturity by now.</p><p>However, they will most likely change in size/shape with pregnancy, weight fluctuations and aging. (Jerome Edelstein, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Your breasts are most likely done (or very nearly done) growing. If you desire larger breasts contact a board certified plastic surgeon to discuss your options (implants or fat transfer). (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Will my breasts keep growing after 23?</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2720" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-8ab5a7c31cff085398f64f1b4ffe51d8">

</div><p>It is unlikely that your breasts will continue to develop more after this age, unless other factors play in such as weight gain, hormone imbalances, or pregnancy. Every woman’s breast size and shape is unique. Many women have breast surgery if they are not happy with their breasts after they are fully developed. Procedures such as breast implants or fat grafting can increase the volume and improve the shape of breasts. (Michelle Spring, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Growth Usually Stops By Age 20</h3><p>Although breast growth varies from patient to patient, it generally stops between 16 and 20 years of age. Even though growth stops, the breast continues to undergo changes for the remainder of a women’s life. This is affected by weight gain, pregnancy, lactation and gravity. At 23, it’s unlikely that your breasts will change without a life changing event such as pregnancy or weight gain. In patients with stable breast size, breast augmentation is definitely a consideration. (Richard J. Bruneteau, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2722" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h3>Breasts Stop Growing Before 23 Years of Age</h3><p>Normally, breast development begins between the ages of 7 and 13 and ends at approximately 18 years of age. These are average numbers and there are certainly potential exceptions.</p><p>Sometimes different forms of birth control pills can lead to some degree of breast enlargement. In general however, you should expect your breasts to have stopped growing by the age of 23. (John J. Edney, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Your breast can change for many years. Weight loss or gain, pregnancy and breast feeding, and certain medications can alter your breast size as well as loss of skin tone may alter the shape. (Howard N. Robinson, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It is unlikely that your breast size will change unless you gain a significant amount of weight.</p><p>Pregnancy can also change your breasts, but generally it does not make them larger in the long run. (Shim Ching, MD, Honolulu Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There is no way to tell if your breasts will continue to grow with time. The thing that will affect them the most as far as the size s concern is weight gain. If you gain weight, your breast will likely get larger. (Ronald J. Edelson, MD, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Girls breast development is complete by age 16-18. Things that can affect size after that are hormones and weight gain. Birth control pills have a low amount of hormone, but it is enough in some people to increase both breast size and overall body weight. (M. Scott Haydon, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I think it is unlikely your breasts will grow more, but if you have not been on birth control pills, then try them for 6 months, and they may stimulate some breast growth. (Gregory Sexton, MD, Columbia Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Unlikely however pregnancy may increase breast size. A number of my patients have reported significant growth of breasts with each pregnancy that did not go away after breastfeeding. I think, however, these are incidental patients. (Stefan Mark Szczerba, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Typically breast size and shape is dependant on a few different factors including but not limited to weight fluctation (gain or loss), hormonal changes, oral contraceptive use, and prengnacy and resulting breast feeding. Depeding on where you are in your cycle may influence breast size as well.</p><p>Generally, if you are not happy with your size and you wish to have a fuller bust, you would be a candidate for breast augmentation surgery. Look for a board certified plastic surgeon and set up a consultation and review your options. (Fadi Chahin, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>When will breast stop growing?</h3><p>At twenty three years old girl breasts are fully developed. Your breasts may grow do to weight gain or pregnancy, but you are far past puberty so don’t expect any big changes in your figure otherwise.</p><p>The only reason breasts would continue to grow past puberty would be from a condition known as juvenile gigantomastia. Judging by your question you obviously do not have this condition, therefore you might consider a breast augmentation if you are unhappy with the size. (Jaime Perez, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Different factors can affect breast size</h3><p>Breast size can depend on several factors. Pregnancy, menses, oral contraceptive use, and weight gain/loss can change the overall size and shape of your breasts. If you are unhappy with the size and shape of your breasts consult with a board certified plastic surgeon to determine if breast augmentation is right for you. (Scott Farber, MD, Boca Raton Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>By 23 years old your breasts will no longer grow. They may become larger with weight gain, during pregnancy, or from birth control pills. (Michael Horn, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>At what age do breast stop growing in female?</h3><p>Whilst most women’s breasts stop growing in their late teens, there can still be some breast growth up until about 21-years old in a few women. If you are 23 now, I suspect that you will not experience any further breast growth. However, please be reassured that at a 34B, you have a completely normal breast size. (Marc Pacifico, MD, FRCS(Plast), London Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Female breast development at age 23</h3><p>Your breast size may increase based on hormonal influences such as pregnancy, use of oral contraception, or weight gain. By age 23, female “growth” is complete.</p><p>Don’t feel badly about looking 7 years younger; in the years to come, you will be thrilled to have a more youthful appearance than your peers. (Robert L. Kraft, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I am sorry to say by age 23 female breasts are fully grown. I would not expect much natural change in size. It is possible your breasts will change in size with pregancy or weight gain. Otherewise I would recommend you consider Breast Augmentation. (Todd B. Koch, MD, Buffalo Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>No, it is not probably, only your breast volume can increase if you gain weight , please consult a plastic surgeon. (Maria Cristina Picon, MD, Argentina Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Female breast development should be complete by 23 under almost any circumstance. Weight gain and weight loss will affect the size and shape of breasts. (Kenneth B. Hughes, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>By age 23 the female body has reached is hereditary stature. The breast is made of glandular and fatty tissue and the size after age 23 generally does not grow except in a few circumstances. One is during pregnancy.</p><p>Breast glandular tissue will swell during pregnancy in anticipation of breast feeding and milk production. The breast will increase in size, however when you stop breast feeding this size increase is rapidly lost. The second way is through weight gain. In weight gain only the fatty tissue of the breast will increase and the glandular tissue will remain the same.</p><p>When the overall weight is lost, so too will the weight and size gained in the breast. There is a rare but benign condition in which the breast continues to grow and can lead to extremely large breasts.</p><p>This condition is called hereditary juvenile breast hypertrophy and often requires breast reduction surgery to correct the problem.</p><p>The most reliable way to increase the size of female breast after age 23 is through breast augmentation surgery.</p><p>Speak to a board certified plastic surgeon who can help you through the process and address your individual needs. (Christopher Khorsandi, MD, Dubai Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I am sorry that I don’t have a positive answer to it specially in the absence of any photos. Perhaps sooner or later you need to get a breast implant in from the best PS in your locality. Wishing you all the luck. (Ashok Govila, FRCS, MCh, MS, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
