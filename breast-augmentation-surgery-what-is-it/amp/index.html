The photo on the left is a reasonable simulation of the contour after a lift.</p><p>If you wish more volume, implants can be added at the time or at a later time.</p><p>Implants as a stand alone procedure are likely to give an unsatisfying outcome, with the breast seeming to drape of the implants.

</div><p>A breast lift or mastopexy will give you a better youthful look. Breast augmentation should be added only if you want bigger breasts. (Vincent N. Zubowicz, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Uplift or Augmentation of Breasts</h3><p>In grey zone cases I am comfortable with an augmentation induced uplift because of simplicity, economy, less incision length, less discomfort etc. You are not grey zone. You are an absolute uplift using the vertical technique of Hall Findlay. Your breasts look of good size but if you want larger you could consider an augmentation and vertical uplift.  (George Commons, MD, Palo Alto Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5321" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-06a1a06cc8830174602f4e0e25999fef">

</div><p>From reviewing your photographs it appears that you have a moderate degree of breast sagging and you would benefit from a breast lift. If you would like more volume then a breast augmentation could also be performed at the same time. (Jeffrey Zwiren, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Plastic surgery breast augmentation and/or breast uplift</h3><p>Posting your photographs in different position is very helpfull. Your breasts are asymmetrical, left breast slightly larger and more saggy in contrast to the right one. Both of them are moderately ptotic . Your nipples move to the level of your infra mammary lines( where your breasts meet the chest wall) in raising your arms. If you are happy with the volume of your breast when they are in a well fitted bra, the only thing you need is either a combination of small implant+ lift on the R breast and only a lift on the L breast.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5323" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-c5a320fa69312d561fc6cd54de925dff">

</div><p>However if you want to have larger breasts , different size implants and breast uplifts would give you the best results. To minimize scaring your uplift and augmentation could be performed through incisions around areolas. I have achieive good results with this approach for many of my patients. (Fereydoon S. Mahjouri, MD, Minneapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Plastic surgery breast augmentation or lift?</h3><p>You appear to have significant sagging which would require a breast lift for correction. To assess the volume of your breasts you would really need to be examined. But your photos suggest that you may have enough volume and may be able to avoid implants. (George Lefkovits, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast lift to improve shape, breast implants to improve volume.</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5322" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>It is particularly good of you to include a festive photo in front of the Christmas tree. Plastic surgery breast augmentation will only increase the volume of your breasts and will not significantly change the shape of your breasts. You would need a breast lift to bring the breast back up on your chest in to a more youthful position, however this inevitably creates scars and carries potential complications. You would need to balance the risks against the benefits depending on how unhappy you are with your breasts at the moment.</p><p>If you would like bigger breasts, then you would need breast implants to enhance the volume. However, if you had breast implants without a lift, then your nipples would still sit low and it may not look good, so a lift with implants may be the answer. You would need to have a good discussion with a plastic surgeon to go over your goals and the pros and cons of the various options. (Jonathan J. Staiano, FRCS (Plast), Birmingham Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>A Breast Lift or Breast Implants?</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5324" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>You have breast ptosis, or saggiung, making a lift necessary. This will be like putting on a push-up bra.</p><p>If you also want to be larger, then you will require implants in addition to your lift. (Matthew Schulman, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Your degree of ptosis usually requires a lift to get the results a patient is looking for. However, each patient is different with regard to their likes and dislikes. An implant alone would give you bigger, saggier breasts. (W. Tracy Hankins, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Perky & Youthful Breasts or Larger & Saggier Breasts?</h3><p>You seem to have quite a bit of breast tissue which is partially responsible for the saggy appearance.</p><p>The bulk of your breast tissue is concerntrated at the bottom while the tops look flat.</p><p>If you choose to have implants you are adding more weight to already sagging breasts.</p><p>This will cause the bottom of your breasts to be larger and saggier while it will not add fullness to the top which is what your breasts are lacking.</p><p>With the amount of breast tissue you have, an experienced Plastic Surgeon should be able to lift and push the lower bulk of the breasts without sacrificing any breast tissue and use the tissues to fill the upper part and give you more projection, making your breasts perkier and more yourthful. (Ivan Thomas, MD (retired), Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Lift with or without cosmetic surgery breast augmentation</h3><p>Thanks for your question and pictures. If you are happy with your size in a bra or slightly larger than you desire-you can do a breast lift alone. If you desire an increase in size, then you will need an implant. (Vishnu Rumalla, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cosmetic surgery breast augmentation or lift?</h3><p>I think you definitely need a lift. As for implants that would be done to increase volume and give more superior pole projection. (Steven Wallach, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cosmetic surgery breast augmentation, lift, or both</h3><p>You have several options all of which can provide a very nice result. The most important thing to do first is to decide what you would like to accomplish. If you feel like you would want to either increase your overall breast volume or to increase your upper pole fullness I would consider a breast implant as this would provide both increased volume and increased upper pole fullness.</p><p>If you want to reshape and tighten your breasts and avoid a breast implant, knowing that your upper pole fullness will be somewhat improved but not perfectly so, then a breast lift alone will accomplish that. Of course, you may elect a breast augmentation and breast lift which will combine the benefits of both. (Remus Repta, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>What to do breast lift and or augmentation?</h3><p>What you desire is the most important thing! If you desire smaller perky breasts then a lift with reduction is the way to go. You can also just do a lift and stay fuller but the longevity of the result will be shorter.</p><p>Implants can always be placed to add volume and I suggest you make a list of what you desire and meet with a few board certified plastic surgeons for consultation. (Gregory Lynam, MD, Richmond Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Lift</h3><p>Consider only a breast lift. Implants alone are likely to cause additional sagging over time. A lift will give a higher firmer appearance and improve the shape. If you have a strong desire for significant fullness in the upper portion, you can add implants to the lift. You should meet with board certified plastic surgeon to discuss your desires. (Adam Hamawy, MD, Princeton Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cosmetic surgery breast augmentation or Lift</h3><p>What (if anything) you “should” do depends on your goals and expectations. Without these specifics, my thoughts are: Consider the option of “doing nothing”. Although body image is subjective, there is nothing aesthetically displeasing about your breasts. Breast augmentation alone will result in larger, heavier breasts with increased ptosis (sagging). Breast lift, in your case, would require at least some breast tissue removal for contouring (“mini-reduction”). You would have to decide if the resulting permanent scars are worth the final result. Get several PS consultations to understand the benefit/risks of surgery. (Stephen M. Lazarus, MD, Knoxville Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Augmentation or Lift</h3><p>Whether you do anything or not is up to you. Ahestheically speaking you could be considered to be ptotic (droopy). A breast lift could be done but there are scars as a tradeoff. If you are happy with size, I would not add an implant.</p><p>It would be my recommendation for you to see a board certified Plastic surgeon and get a formal exam with measurements. This would help with what would be best for you. (Scott R. Brundage, MD, Grand Rapids Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cosmetic surgery breast augmentation or Lifting?</h3><p>What surgical procedure, if any, that you will benefit from will depend mainly on your goals. Your breasts demonstrate breast “ptosis” which means that the breasts and the nipple/areola complexes sit somewhat low on your chest wall. If the position of the breasts are of concern to then you will benefit from breast lifting surgery.</p><p>The trade-off associated with breast lifting surgery is the presence of scars, which may or may not be bothersome to you ( especially if you are a new sunbather). You will not do well with breast augmentation surgery alone. However, if one of your goals is to increase breast size/fullness, then breast augmentation ( along with a breast lift) will be indicated.</p><p>You will benefit from in-person consultation with board certified plastic surgeons. Ask to see lots of examples of their work helping patients achieve the types of results you are looking for. Communicate your goals with your plastic surgeon carefully; in my practice I find the use of goal pictures helpful during this communication process. (Tom J. Pousti, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
