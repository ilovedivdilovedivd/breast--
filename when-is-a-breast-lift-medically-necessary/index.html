<p>I agree with the suggestion of your surgeon. Properly placed implants is all that is required to acheive a nice augmentation. (Justin Yovino, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>That all you need is a well selected implant, not any breast lift. This is because your nipples are not low at all. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>Even though you have lost some volume with weight loss, your skin has bounced back into shape very nicely. You have minimal sagging (&#8220;ptosis&#8221;) in your breasts, and, therefore, a breast lift is not indicated or necessary.</p>
<p>If you want to regain some of your lost volume, a breast augmentation alone would do the trick. (Robert Stroup, Jr., MD, FACS, Cleveland Plastic Surgeon)</p>

<p>Your youth and skin elasticity have helped you avoid necessary a breast lift (of ANY kind). Submuscular implants will yield a beautiful result with your anatomy, and if after consultation and careful informed consideration you request them, present-generation cohesive silicone gel implants will yield your best, softest, and most natural results with the least likelihood of visible rippling, no risk of deflation, and essentially equal risk for any other type of concern. Your plastic surgeon has advised you correctly.</p>
<p>Research silicone gel implants, click on the link below, and get one or more consults if your surgeon does not offer this option if you wish it. Off-label use of silicone gel implants is perfectly legal, and no different from a plastic surgeon who uses Botox for crows feet (NOT an FDA-approved indication; an off-label use). (Richard H. Tholen, MD, FACS, Minneapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Breast lift and implant</h3>
<div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4719" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 115px"><a href="when-is-a-breast-lift-needed-image/index.html" rel="attachment wp-att-4719"><meta itemprop="width" content="105"><meta itemprop="height" content="200"><img itemprop="url" itemprop="image" class="size-medium wp-image-4719" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/When-is-a-breast-lift-needed-image-105x200.jpg" alt="When is a breast lift needed image" width="105" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">When is a breast lift needed image</p></div>
<p>From the photos, you have minimal &#8220;sagging&#8221;. Therefore, I think you would get a good result from just placing an implant. (David A. Lickstein, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Do I need a breast lift?</h3>
<p>From your photos it looks like you do not need a lift. An easy way to tell is to look at your breasts head on&#8211;if you have a fair amount of normal breast skin below the areola (you have this) then you should be fine without a lift. In general you want the fold under the breast to be at or below the level of the nipple if you transposed the fold level to the front of your breasts. (Mahlon Kerr, MD, FACS, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t in my opinion need a lift at all. The larger the implant that you use the more &#8220;lift&#8221; you will get. You can always get a lift later, and having implants now will not burn any bridges for doing a lift, if you need one in the future. Silicone implants would be better for you because of your small amount of tissue.</p>
<div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4722" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 210px"><a href="when-is-a-breast-lift-needed-question/index.html" rel="attachment wp-att-4722"><meta itemprop="width" content="200"><meta itemprop="height" content="150"><img itemprop="url" itemprop="image" class="size-medium wp-image-4722" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/When-is-a-breast-lift-needed-question-200x150.jpg" alt="When is a breast lift needed question" width="200" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">When is a breast lift needed question</p></div>
<p>I would suggest anything from a B cup to a big C sup would look nice, depending on your goals. (Dan Mills, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>In my opinion you will get a great result with breast augmentation alone. My choice: Anatomic shaped implants (f.e. Allergan Style 410). The result will be more natural. Silicone high cohesive gel implants (Tru Form 3) in order to try to avoid rippling in a near future. Submuscular implant placement (Dual I or II) (Enrique Etxeberria, MD, Spain Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>You should do fine with just an augment and, given the lack of breast tissue, I would recommend silicone for you placed under the muscle. (Robert L. Kraft, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4723" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 210px"><a href="when-is-a-breast-lift-needed-photo-before/index.html" rel="attachment wp-att-4723"><meta itemprop="width" content="200"><meta itemprop="height" content="150"><img itemprop="url" itemprop="image" class="size-medium wp-image-4723" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/When-is-a-breast-lift-needed-photo-before-200x150.jpg" alt="When is a breast lift needed photo before" width="200" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">When is a breast lift needed photo before</p></div>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t appear from your pictures that you&#8217;d be a candidate for a lift &#8211; an implant alone without any additional mastopexy (breastlift) should lift the breast nicely. However, there are several other things to consider when you&#8217;re planning breast augmentation including implant size, profile, incision placement, and implant types. These are all things you don&#8217;t want to try to guess or take advice strictly based on forum responses. Many of my patients are often surprised by the choices and considerations they’re faced with when considering a breast augmentation. See me discuss the decisions you&#8217;ll need to make in the video or read about them in the web reference. (Ricardo L. Rodriguez, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>A little softening or deflation of the breast does not mean a lift is medically necessary. We start to think about a lift when the nipple descends further down towards the crease under the breast.</p>
<p>All you would need, if you want it, is an augment. You have so little thickness to your breast tissues that you will get the best result with submuscular silicone implants in my opinion.</p>
<p>Although the FDA recommends patients younger than 22 not have silicone, it is still possible to have them if your doctor feels the saline ones would be inappropriate. (Ronald V. DeMars, MD, Portland Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>Implants are all you need. You have a little asymmetry but nicely shaped breasts. You should get a great result. (Ronald Schuster, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Do I need a breast lift along with implants?</h3>
<p>Judging from your photos it would appear that you do not need a lifting and that implants would be sufficient. But ultimately a physical exam would be conclusive in deciding on that . (George Lefkovits, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Do I need a lift after weight loss ?</h3>
<p>Congratulations on your weight loss. You&#8217;ve done a remarkable job. Based upon your examination, with your nipples well above the fold of your breasts, you do not need a breast lift. As you can see from some of the other Physicians comments you have a broader space between the breasts and some slight narrowing of the base. I recommend that you try on implant sizers as well to help you make your implant to decision prior to surgery. In my own practice I have found that when patients try on implant sizers prior to surgery it helps them to get a sense of what they will look like after surgery.</p>
<p>Because your chest is boad you may wish to consider a wider implant. From what I see here I do not believe you require a lift. (Adam Tattelbaum, MD, Washington DC Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>I would agree with your plastic surgeon that you do NOT need a breast lift. I would just point out that your breasts are rather widely spaced, and will tend to stay that way regardless of the technique used.</p>
<p>I would discuss the pros and cons of submuscular versus subglandular silicone with your plastic surgeon, assuming that in Canada they are allowed at your age. Also congratulations on the weight loss. (Paul W. Loewenstein, MD, Milwaukee Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>You do not have droopy breasts. Your nipples are not below the breast fold and therefore a breast lift is not required. Looking at your picture, you are a great candidate for a breast augmentation. A transaxillary approach would leave you without any scars on your breasts, and depending on your size desires, you might be able to get a silicone OR saline implant in through this approach.</p>
<p>Also, looking at your picture I do want to point out that you have two different breasts and hopefully your PS has discussed this with you. your right breasts is narrower and more vertical, your left has a more horizontal breast fold. These are features that will be there after a breast augmentation. This is normal and expected but sometimes patients are unaware of the fact that their breasts are different and feel it is because of the surgery. (Toronto Cosmetic Surgery Institute) (Martin Jugenburg, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>While you certainly do not need a breast lift, care needs to be taken to address the narrow base of your breasts. A sub pectoral or dual-plane augmentation (which is what most will offer you) will accentuate the wide space between your breasts and their narrow appearance. A high profile implant, which is again what most will offer, will also accentuate these features.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend a wide low profile implant placed subfascially for the best results in your body type. It is hard to find doctors that perform true subfascial augmentation so you may have to opt for sub glandular placement which may offer you an excellent result but won&#8217;t have the longevity of a subfascial placement.</p>
<p>My preference is to use a technique called &#8216;cold-subfascial&#8217; augmentation. This technique preserves all of the strength of the pectorals fascia and uses it to support and shape the implant into a tear-drop appearing breast. It acts like a bra inside the breast and gives long term support unlike the commonly used techniques. (Rian A. Maercks, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>Overall, your skin has responded quite well. Your breasts do not have significant ptosis (falling breasts). Therefore, I agree that you will likely not benefit from a lift in conjunction with implants. The benefits of not having a lift is the option not to have scars around the areola, unless your surgeon opts for this type of incision for implant insertion.</p>
<p>What you medically necessary to recognize is that your breasts are not symmetric. This is true for all patients! It appears that your right breast is slightly smaller than the left and that you nipple position on the right breast (lower) is different than the left breast as well.</p>
<p>Having a breast implant without nipple repositioning with often unmasks slight asymmetries. Also, in the middle of your chest you have a slight depression which may indicate that your breast bone has a slight depression. This may also appear worse with larger breasts.</p>
<p>Overall, I think you will have an excellent result, but I think it&#8217;s always important to know all of the slight variables which will impact your result and how you see your result. (Michael S. DeWolfe, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>When the breast tissue deflates after multiple pregnancies, it is easy to regain the volume with an implant and even achieve the optical illusion of a lift.</p>
<p>For a fairly thin patient as yourself silicone would be the best option. I would recommend looking at the results of as many patients as you can and find a patient that looks like you in the pre-op photos.</p>
<p>If you are satisfied with the BA only contour, proceed with augmentation only. You can always have a lift at a later time. (Ron Hazani, MD, Brea Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>You are a good candidate for an augmentation/lift procedure to give you the best result. To give you more upper pole fullness, definitely would need implants and to take care of the sagging breast tissue in the lower poles you need a lift.</p>
<p>An augmentation/lift with a vertical or lollipop technique will give you a nice shape, smaller nipple/areolar complexes. See a board certified plastic surgeon for an in person consultation/evaluation. (George Marosan, MD, Bellevue Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>I would recommend that you have a breast lift with your breast augmentation. This will greatly improve your result (Earl Stephenson, Jr., MD, DDS, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>I believe a lift (either vertical or standard) would be required for optimal outcome. (Taylor Theunissen, MD, Baton Rouge Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>Your photos are helpful, but I find that in situations like yours a thorough exam and discussion are needed to discern exactly what you want.</p>
<p>Your breasts sit low on your chest wall (normal variant) and your nipple/areola complex are a bit on the low side as well.</p>
<p>Breast feeding has left you with loose skin that may or may not fill out adequately with an implant alone. Your options include: breast implant with a peri-areolar reduction or breast implant with a more tradition lift (anchor or lollipop). We would need to discuss what your idea of &#8220;perky&#8221; is and what a &#8220;large b or small c&#8221; means to you. My experience has shown that there is such a wide variation of these definitions. We would employ some sizing and photos to help figure this out. My first inclination would be to place a silicone implant under the muscle with a peri-areolar reduction (which will also give you a small lift as well). Done properly by an experienced (surgeon does &gt;100-150 breast procedures/year) board certified plastic surgeon and you should have a very nice result. (Douglas L. Gervais, MD, Honolulu Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4740" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 154px"><a href="../breast-augmentation-or-breast-lift-image/index.html" rel="attachment wp-att-4740"><meta itemprop="width" content="144"><meta itemprop="height" content="190"><img itemprop="url" itemprop="image" class="size-full wp-image-4740" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Breast-augmentation-or-breast-lift-image.jpg" alt="Breast augmentation or breast lift image" width="144" height="190" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Breast augmentation or breast lift image</p></div>
<p>In my opinion, you will likely medically necessary a lift, especially if you want a smaller implant. Additionally, it is not possible to make your areolas smaller unless a lift is done. You are a good candidate for a lollipop pattern scar or vertical mastopexy. Please seek an experienced, board certified plastic surgeon for a consultation. The good news is that you should have a nice result with the appropriate surgery. (Shim Ching, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>An implant will make you larger, and if the nipple is used as the bull&#8217;s eye so to speak, the upper pole of your breast will look fuller. Having said that, the &#8216;new&#8217; breast mound will be exactly where it is now, relatively low on your ribcage. A reduction of the areola can be done without a lift if desired. If you are looking for the breast mound to be higher on your ribcage, what some people refer to as perky, then a lift will be required in my opinion. (Julio Garcia, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Do I need a lift with implants</h3>
<p>This is a very commonly asked question and as has been mentioned, an in person exam will allow your board-certified plastic surgeon better able to recommend your procedure after examining you. Based upon what I see in your photos I would be concerned that your augmented breasts would sit too low on your chest. Please schedule a consultation with one or a few board certified plastic surgeons so that you can make the best choice for you. (Michael C. Edwards, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>If your nipple are above the bottom of your breast which they appear to be you do not need a lift. Obviously I could be more certain with an in person examination. (Frederic H. Corbin, MD, Portland Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Am I a candidate for Breast Augmentation or would I need a lift?</h3>
<p>Of course it would take an exam to confirm what we see from the photos, but it does appear you can get a very nice result with implants alone if you are not interested in much upper breast fullness. Otherwise a lift is necessary. Best to take photos of post op patients (you copy off the internet) in to your surgeon. After showing the doctor what look you want a plan can be made to get you to that goal. (Ronald V. DeMars, MD, )</p>
<p>An implant would give the benefit of more fullness in the upper pole of your breast and a slightly fuller size. You appear to already be in the range of a large B, so I&#8217;m not sure if this is what you would be looking for. Also, if you wanted the areola size decreased, then you would most likely need the scar that would result from (or at least part of the scar) a lift.</p>
<p>I think you would be a good candidate for an implant, possibly with a small lift, but you need an in-person exam with a plastic surgeon in your area to evaluate this. (Erik Hoy, MD, Newark Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>Augmentation alone or augmentation with a lift are both an option. If you wish to have your nipples sit higher, you do need a lift. A lift will also allow to make your areolas smaller (Martin Jugenburg, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Breast Lift and Implant.</h3>
<p>I like your sense of humor. From the looks of your photos and given your goals, a lift with an implant is the best approach. (Justin Yovino, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Implant vs implant and lift</h3>
<p>Based on your photos you submitted, it&#8217;s hard for me to tell where exactly your breast fold is in regard to your nipple/areola complex.</p>
<p>The correlation of this reveals if a lift if warranted. In some cases, when an implant is placed at time of surgery, the patient is sat up on the table and the need for a lift is determined at that time based on the look of the implant as well as the outcome the patient is looking for. My advice to you would be to go discuss your options with a board certified plastic surgeon. (Michael Ian Rose, MD, Red Bank Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Breast Augmentation or Mastopexy</h3>
<p>I would recommend that you schedule a consultation with a board certified plastic surgeon in your geographical area. Upon consultation and examination your surgeon will be able to make a treatment recommendation to address your concerns. (Christine Sullivan, MD, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>Breast implants are fillers. They do not change the shape, but make them larger. Consult with a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon for an exam to determine if you will be happier with larger breast, or larger breast with a perky look. Based on your photos, you appear to be a candidate for either. (Robert E. Zaworski, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Lift vs. Augment</h3>
<p>You would do very well with an augment alone, but they will not be &#8220;high and perky&#8221;, and possibly larger than you are hoping for. Nipple position typically does not change noticeably after augmentation (it looks different). Usually when people say that they are looking for more of a lifted look to take up some of the extra skin without overcompensating with a larger than desired implant. In your photos your nipples arent necessarily low, so you would do well to talk to a couple plastic surgeons in your area and convey your goals, while making sure to clearly point out/explain the kind of results you are looking for. (Zach Barnes, MD, Bakersfield Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>I think you could achieve great looking breasts with implants alone with a dual plane technique and properly selected implants. However, if your goal is truly to raise your nipple up more than 1 centimeter, then you should consider a lift with your augmentation. If you have the resources and time, it is always safe and more predictable to get undergo augmentation and then undergo lift later. (Jason Mussman, MD, Phoenix Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>The pictures show that your breasts are set rather low on your chest wall&#8211;this is a normal variant, and not really subject to change.A lift is done to correct sagging by elevating the areolas and correcting excess skin (either by removing it or filling out the breast with implants). From the photos, it appears to me that the areolas are pretty close to normal position.</p>
<p>The bottom of the areola should be even with or higher than the breast fold. Adding to my difficulty is not fully understanding your goal. Many patients of about your size will tell me their size is a small C. You will be better served by consulting with a plastic surgeon in your area who can review your goals, and how to get there.</p>
<p>My inclination based on just what I have here is to suggests implants (assuming you want to be larger) and an areolar reduction or peri-areolar lift if you are having an areolar incision anyway. (Jourdan Gottlieb, MD, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>This is a difficult call from photos alone. An implant may raise your nipple position several centimeters, but ideally you want placement to be in the center of the breast mound. You might find an improvement in shape with a periareolar lift (mini lift). Find a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon and make an appointment to be evaluated in person.</p>
<p>Take along some pictures of women with a similar frame to you who have the look you&#8217;d like to achieve. Listen to what they have to say about how best to help you reach your goals. Good luck. (Mary Lee Peters, MD, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p>

<p>Obviously I could be more certain with an in person examination. (Frederic H. Corbin, MD, Portland Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Breast lift medically necessary or not</h3>
<p>All depends on your goals. You look like you could have a breast augmentation only and have larger and less deflated looking breasts. If you have a lift at the same time then you can make the aerola smaller and maximize the perkiness, and position on your chest wall. But there is more scar with that choice. Have a consultation and discuss all the options. (Scott W. Vann, MD, FACS, Savannah Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>Of course it would take an exam to confirm what we see from the photos, but it does appear you can get a very nice result with implants alone if you are not interested in much upper breast fullness. Otherwise a lift is necessary.</p>
<p>Best to take photos of post op patients (you copy off the internet) in to your surgeon. After showing the doctor what look you want a plan can be made to get you to that goal. (Ronald V. DeMars, MD, )</p>
