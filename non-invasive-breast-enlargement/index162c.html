</div><p>Breast enhancement with breast implants is the most common cosmetic surgery performed year after year in the United States mainly because it is generally safe, patients are happy and recovery is reasonable. (Kent V. Hasen, MD, Naples Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Creams don’t work for BA</h3><p>Save your money. There is no cream or pill that has been shown to safely and effectively increase breast size long term. The estrogen or phyto-estrogen pills have only a mild, temporary effect, at best.</p><p>So far, only surgical augmentation – either with an implant, or with fat grafting, gives a long lasting result. (Thomas Fiala, MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Pills and Creams Will Not Safely Enlarge Your Breasts</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1435" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>There are no pills or creams that will safely increase your breast size. A breast enhancement with implants is the most safe and predictable way to increase the size and better the shape of your breasts. (Christopher T. Maloney Jr., MD, Tucson Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Will creams or pills grow breat size</h3><p>I understand the desire but neither will work. If they had actual human type hormones it might, but that would be illegal to sell without a prescription. In those women that I see that are on hormone replacement they typically do not change breast size with their use.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1436" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>If you were to use prescription hormones before the end of puberty you might see a size increase, but that also depends on genetics as not all women will have breast tissue that responds in that way. Sorry. (Julio Garcia, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast enhancement Safest and Most Effective Way</h3><p>The only way to enhance the size of your breasts safely and effectively with predictable results is breast enhancement. You may experience a very minor increase in size with creams and pills, but nothing that will be as noticeable. (Jerome Edelstein, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Making breasts larger</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1437" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>There are no pills or creams that will consistently and safely make breasts larger. the safe way to enlarge your breasts is with breast implants or fat transfer. fat transfer is limited in the size you can achieve. (Connie Hiers, MD, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Topical creams and pills will not help.</h3><p>There are no topical agents or creams applied that can make your breasts enlarge in any significant way. Hormone pills have some health risks that may not be favorable for you. Certainly when you have hormone increases, for example during pregnancy, your breasts will get larger but they will shrink after your pregnancy period and hormone increase is gone away when the pregnancy is over.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1438" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Patients can use Brava, which is a suction device, on their chest but there are always some changes of the skin while the Brava is in use that is not comfortable and wearing a device as a suction cup on your chest wall 6 hours a day is something we do prior to doing autologous fat transfer to your breasts.</p><p>The least complicated surgery that takes about an hour is a breast enhancement using a breast enhancement implant device. The silicone implants have been studied extensively and are a safe method for you to pursue to achieve your appearance goals. (Paul Vanek, MD, Cleveland Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast enhancement Works Extremely Well! Pills and Creams Don’t!</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1439" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>Forget about the pills and creams. They will not give you the improvement you are looking for. As you suspected, hormones can have side effects that are dangerous such as blood clots. For the most part these are gimmicks designed to give you false hope</p><p>Your best approach is to find a board certified plastic surgeon (ABPS certified) who does breast enhancement weekly and has a good reputation and have them perform a breast enhancement. If money is a problem consider, financeing your breast enhancement.</p><p>Many plastic surgeons now have financing options such as Care Credit.You will be happy with the result and get a big boost in self-esteem and confidence. Happiness, on the other hand, is up to you. Of course, women often do tell me they are happier with their larger breasts! (David L. Mobley, MD, FACS, Sarasota Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Pills & Creams Do Not Enhance Breast Size</h3><p>There are no pills or creams on the market which can be expected to safely and effectively make your breasts bigger. (John J. Edney, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nonsurgical Breast Enlargement  – Does it work?</h3><p>Pills and creams do not enlarge the breast, and if they do – you’re right – I’d worry!</p><p>Hormones can exacerbate breast cancer which would be bad. The BRAVA breast suction system is nonsurgical but does not result in long-term maintenance of expanded breast size without fat grafting associated.</p><p>Breast enlargement  runs around $5000-$7000 and there are some great financing options available.</p><p>Long term success and safety are excellent, so I think surgical breast enlargement  makes the most sense financially. (Michele A. Shermak, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>OTC Pills and Creams Don’t Make Breasts Larger</h3><p>Save you money for Breast Implants as over the counter creams, pills, and exercises will not significantly make your breast larger.</p><p>Hormone pills such as Birth Control Pills in many cases will result in a modest increase but is not predictable. (Larry S. Nichter, MD, MS, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>There are no pills or creams that safely enlarge the breasts</h3><p>Breast enlargement with saline or silicone implants is a safe and effective procedure with a long track record. It should be your first choice for enlarging your breasts. Pills and creams don’t work and some can be unhealthy. In the end, this is cosmetic in nature and you shouldn’t risk your health for it. (Parham Ganchi, PhD, MD, Wayne Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Enhancement</h3><p>Besides taking estrogen for the wrong reasons there are no pills and the same goes for creams. Breast enlargement with implants is safe and reliable! (Ryan Neinstein, MD, FRCSC, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Pills and creams</h3><p>Breast enhancements using pills and creams are not a recommended way of augmenting your appearance. Many of these creams are bogus and the pills may function on a hormonal level. This has not been studied and may put you at risk for problems including increase risk of breast cancer down the road. Consult a board-certified plastic surgeon to discuss your options for breast enlargement. (Christopher Khorsandi, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Bigger BOOBS PILLS OR CREAM??</h3><p>Absolutely no good way of enhancing breasts with creams or pills. Hormonal manipulation to increase breast size not only does it not work, It’s outright dangerous. It can induce changes that can frankly lead to the development of breast and possibly other GYN related tumors/ malignancies. (Mel T. Ortega, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Pills or creams</h3><p>Breast enhancement pills or creams really won’t work for you. Birth control pills can make a woman’s breasts larger, but this can be variable. (Shim Ching, MD, Honolulu Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Enhancement with Creams or Pills</h3><p>There are no pills or creams that will make your breasts bigger in any significant way. Do not be tricked into spending a lot of money for pills or creams despite the promises that accompany them.Such medications are typically only prescribed for transgender patients by doctors as hormonal replacement pills.</p><p>Even so, these pills come with substantial side effects, and that is why it is necessary to be prescribed by doctors only. The best solution for increasing breast size is augmentation surgery. Breast implants are cheaper, easier and safer to place than hormonal therapy. (Jeffrey Weinzweig, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Pills and creams for breast enlargement don’t work</h3><p>There are no creams or pills that will selectively make your breasts work, so don’t get suckered into spending any money on these false advertisements. They tend to be cheap and so people think to themselves, oh well I’ll try it and if it doesn’t work I haven’t lost a lot of money.</p><p>And that’s how these scam artists work. make it easy and tempting for you to part with your money. In transgender (male to female) patients doctors are able to prescribe hormonal replacement pills however these come with significant side-effects and can be prescribed only by a doctor.</p><p>Because of their significant side-effects, you won’t find a doctor who will prescribed them to you unless you are a male-to-female transgender person. It is simply safer, easier, and cheaper to get breast implants than it is to go on a hormone therapy. (Martin Jugenburg, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>No Pills or Creams to make your breasts bigger</h3><p>Unfortunately there are no Pills or Creams which can safely make your breasts larger safely.</p><p>Even though increasing some hormone levels may increase your breast tissue, there are serious health risks in taking hormones long term.</p><p>Also the effect will be unpredictable and only last as long as you are using the hormones.</p><p>As for creams, there is definately nothing available that will increase breast tissue, although I am sure there are plenty of Snake Oil salesmen out there promoting that they can!</p><p>The safest and most reliable way to increase your breast size is with a breast augmentation using an implant. It is a very common procedure with predictable results.</p><p>I suggest you go and see a plastic surgeon in your area and discuss the surgery. It may not be as expensive as you think. (Richard Bloom, MBBS, FRACS, Melbourne Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Non invasive breast enlargement?</h3><p>The safest and most effective way to enlarge your breasts is with a breast augmentation. Breast augmentation is a very common procedure and very safe when performed by a board certified plastic surgeon.</p><p>It can be performed as outpatient surgery (you don’t have to spend the night in the hospital), and most women are back to work within a few days. I suggest you visit with at least one board certified plastic surgeon to discuss this is more detail. (James Knoetgen, III, MD, Fresno Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>I would definitely avoid pills and creams for breast enlargement</h3><p>To date, the only non-surgical method of enlarging the breasts that has shown any scientific evidence of efficacy has been the Brava suction device, and even then it is controversial as to how effective it is and how long lasting its results are. Pills and creams to enlarge breasts are at best shams which have no effect and at worst they could be dangerous because of hormones or other systemic substances which could have damaging effects like even promoting cancer.</p><p>Fat transfer is available for breast enlargement, and although we don’t use implants, that is still a surgical procedure, and the volumes that we can achieve with that are limited.</p><p>My best advice would be for you to decide what your true priorities are, and if that includes larger, fuller breasts, then commit to undergoing a breast augmentation with implants. If that is not your top priority, then I would find the best bras that you can to make your breasts the most attractive, and leave the creams and pills and other breast potions alone. (Joseph L. Grzeskiewicz, MD, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast pills/creams</h3><p>I wish I could say that these pills and creams work to enhance your breast size, but the evidence is sadly lacking. There is no real effective long term breast enhancement treatment that does not involve surgery or I assure you I would be offering it.</p><p>If you are really interested in breast augmentation, I would do some research in your area of board certified plastic surgeons in your area and have a couple of consults to see if you are a good candidate and what your costs would be. At that point you can make an educated decision about your breast enhancement surgery.(Robert Steely, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>No pills, no creams.</h3><p>I hear this a lot in my practice – and unfortunately there is no magical solution like a pill or cream that will work long term. We do know that hormones can affect the development of breast tissue. However, there can be serious side effects and other concerns with any time of hormone medication and these should only be taken under medical supervision. I believe that the best way to enlarge your breasts is with a breast augmentation procedure using FDA approved breast implants. (Rocco C. Piazza, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
