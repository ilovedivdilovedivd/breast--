The obvious problem with this procedure is in its inherent inaccuracy for surgery.</p><p>Because the creation of the implant pocket is a precise procedure, the farther away you are, the more difficult it is to be precise. (Think of painting a picture with a 6 inch paintbrush versus a 6 foot paintbrush.).</p><p>This leads to common problems with asymmetry and poor cosmetic outcomes.</p><p>The standard incisions for breast augmentation under the breast or around the aerola are rarely troublesome. They also afford a more reliable cosmetic outcome. I would recommend not compromising the results of the breast augmentation (the reason for surgery) for the minor improvement in scarring. (David Bogue, MD, Boca Raton Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast augmentation through the belly button is possible</h3><p>A breast augmentation through the belly button is also known as a trans umbilical breast augmentation. It is possible to perform the surgery in certain select patients. Patients appreciate the lack of incisions around their breast or torso. However, patients should understand that only saline implants may be used with this technique. Patients should also look closely at the manufacturers warranty as the warranty is often avoided with this technique.

</div><p>The “Through the Belly Button” breast implant operation has several pitfalls or many more plastic surgeons would do it:</p><ol>
<li>It can result in the development of visible tunnels or depressions leading from abdomen to the base of each breast. These are not universal but when they form they are difficult to fix. I have seen a few patients with these.</li>
<li>Implant position control. It is hard to get as close to even with this operation as with other breast implant placement procedures.</li>
<li>Bleeding control. Working that far away from the breast increases the possibilities of bleeding. We can’t see as well from that far away even when using special equipment. (John P. Di Saia, MD, Orange Plastic Surgeon)</li>

</div><p>There are many techniques available to augment the female breast. Incisions vary in terms of their long term scarring. To surgeons, incision placement allows for safe and efficient dissection of the anatomic area involved. Often, it is difficult to meticulously dissect the upper pole of the breast and lower pole of the breast through the transumbilical technique, leading to breasts that have upper or lower pole fullness with an unaesthetic appearance. Further, silicone cannot be placed through the umbilicus. (Raffy Karamanoukian, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>By placing implants through the belly button you may avoid a scar on the breast however you tremendously increase the chance of the breasts appearing lop-sided and asymmetric due to poor implant placement. Fixing it usually requires another surgery leaving a scar on the breast that you originally set out to avoid.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4365" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-616770de351ecbe132babf5831dfd60f">

</div><p>Consider a transaxillary (thru the armpit) placement if you are absolutely adverse to against having a breast scar. (Adam Hamawy, MD, Princeton Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It is admirable to minimize the resulting scar from any operation. However, scars from breast augmentation (regardless of the route) are almost never an issue after breast augmentation.</p><p>The TUBA (trans umbilical breast augmentation) is a tedious operation through a remote site that might possibly damage the implant. And there is a scar in the navel. (Vincent N. Zubowicz, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The breast implant manufacturers think that breast augmentation through the belly button is such a bad idea (possible damage to implant) that they void their warranty if the operation is done this way. That should tell you something. (George J. Beraka, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>While some doctors use it and swear by it, I think it is what I would call a long run for a short slide especially in lieu of a periareolar incision that statistically heals the best of all scars.</p><p>The belly button approach is a blind technique from the furthest distance you can get from the palce of action, the breast.</p><p>It is nearly impossible to correct problems with the implant or pocket from this incision and since a majority of women with implants will come to a second surgery within 10 years, patients will often need an incision on the breasts for these secondary surgeries anyways.</p><p>You can also only place a saline implant with this approach and most surgeons can perform a saline implantation through a relative short incision (1″).</p><p>Surgeons are often not only concerned with achieving a good result, but with avoiding problems, especially in an elective procedure. (Robin T.W. Yuan, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There are so many reasons why no one wants to do this operation. In my opinion, this is a stupid operation that should never have seen the light of day, period. The main reason is that the results are usually not as good, often lop sided, and in my opinion, generally sub par (if, for example, you compare a series of consecutive cases –  sure, you can cherry pick good examples with good results, but what are they like on average?). You always have to use saline implants only with this operation (which always give a lower quality IMO) I would never want any of my friends or anyone in my family to have this operation because it has to be done in a blind manner, where a lot is left to chance.</p><p>In surgery, i don’t want ANYTHING left to chance. I want to CONTROL everything to make sure that everything comes out exactly the way I want it to. It is just plain dumb to consider this operation, period.</p><p>Besides, all implants will eventually require replacement. No one can replace or revise an augmented breast through the belly button. That means that eventually, you will have two scars on the breast anyways. (Claudio DeLorenzi, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It’s a blind procedure with little control of your breast pocket. You are limited to saline implants with this option. There’s a reason none of the surgeons you have seen recommend it. (Asif Pirani, MD, FRCS(C), Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The only real advantage to the TUBA (Trans-Umbilical Breast Augementation) is the scar and the marketing benefit. Other than that, there are numerous disdavantages: inability to place silicone implants, limited pocket visualization, difficulty in achieving hemostasis, rough handling of the implant, risk of abdominal scarring along dissection path, disruption of infra-mammary fold, lack of utility in breast implant remove and replace procedures, use of blunt dissection and lack of precise pocket preparation, inability to manage breast asymmetry, etc. (Otto Joseph Placik, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast implant through the belly button</h3><p>The only real advantage to placing implants through the trans-umbilical approach is the scar. Since most scars heal well, this is not a huge advantage. There are however numerous disadvantages to this approach. First, silicone gel implants cannot be used. Second, revisions are relatively more common. Lastly, it is much more challenging to reliably place the implant in the appropriate position in regards to the muscle. Still, there are a number of plastic surgeons who favor this approach. Just make sure your surgeon prefers this operation for the right reasons, and not as a marketing ploy to increase business. (Kelly Gallego, MD, FACS, Yuba City Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There are so many reasons why no one wants to do this operation. In my opinion, this is a stupid operation that should never have seen the light of day, period. The main reason is that the results are usually not as good, often lop sided, and in my opinion, generally sub par (if, for example, you compare a series of consecutive cases- sure, you can cherry pick good examples with good results, but what are they like on average?).</p><p>You always have to use saline implants only with this operation (which always give a lower quality IMO) I would never want any of my friends or anyone in my family to have this operation because it has to be done in a blind manner, where a lot is left to chance.

Besides, all implants will eventually require replacement. No one can replace or revise an augmented breast through the belly button. That means that eventually, you will have two scars on the breast anyways. (Claudio DeLorenzi, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Breast implants through belly button is a popular requested procedure because of the limited scarring and distant location of entry through the umbilicus.</p><p>It was popular to put saline implants in that way because they can be rolled up like a cigarette before inflation.</p><p>However, even with that being said, it can be difficult to control problems with the pocket and bleeding through this approach. Silicone gel implants can not be placed this way. (Steven Wallach, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast implants through belly button is fraught with more potential complications.</h3><p>First allow me to say that it is imperative that you see a board certified plastic surgeon that is experienced in breast surgery, especially in breast augmentation procedures. You need to discuss the various options and alternatives of surgery as it applies to you. Breast augmentation through the belly button portal is fraught with more potential complications.</p><p>The most common problem that I have seen with patients seeking a second opinion is issues with mal-position of the implants. In general, I discourage this approach and technique. Again, this is a great question that deserves to be discussed at length with an experienced plastic surgeon. (Stephen A. Goldstein, MD)</p><p>Almost all Board Certified Plastic Surgeons are upstanding, ethical, hard working, well-trained professionals who really want the best for their patients. Sometimes this leads us to make choices to NOT perform surgeries that have been popularized on TV because they do not make sense or are not in the best interest of our patients.</p><p>TUBA is one of these. It doesn’t even make logical sense. The best augmentations come from creating perfectly symmetrical pockets for the implants. Implants cannot correct for imperfect pockets. The great distance from the umbilicus to the breast eliminates the possibility of fashioning perfect pockets every day for every patient. The TUBA also doesn’t allow for absolute hemostasis and that is why you see bruising on the TV patients. You rarely bruise from the incisions closer to the breast such as the crease or the areola.</p><p>Blood around an implant is bad because it leads to increased rates of capsular contracture. Future corrective surgeries typically require a new incision such as one in the crease so why not just start there and have only one scar? Gel implants are increasingly popular because of their “feel” and can’t be placed via the TUBA. Consequently, most surgeons have rejected this operation for their patients. Sometimes new and popular on TV isn’t actually better! (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I have never been that impressed with the transumbilical approach to breast augmenation but I have never performed the surgery myself. In my opinion the accurate dissection of the implant pocket is critical to obtain a nice result. I would find it difficult to be that precise from such a long distance away. In addition you can only use saline filled implants via the TUBA approach.</p><p>If a patient does not want a scar on the breast then the axillary or under the arm incision is an option. It allows for direct access to the implant pocket as well as direct vision using an endoscope. Precision is the key to a nice result as well as patient selection. Most plastic surgical procedures performed on good candidates for the procedure will get a good result.</p><p>If you desire the TUBA approach then find a plastic surgeon who is well experienced with the technique and ask his or her opinion.
