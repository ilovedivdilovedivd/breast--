Bajaj, MD, Oklahoma City Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It seems very strange to me for a Plastic Surgeon to dictated to a woman what size breast would be best for her.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4437" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-c7b3e0b9854ed013c1592278f6f706f4">

</div><p>I feel very comfortable saying that every woman has a body image what they feel they should look like. After over 30 years of successfully preforming thousands of breast implants for women I believe my technique works well for essentially all of my patients.</p><p>I put the patient in a very stretchy bra and then place low profile gel implants in the bra and keep going bigger until the patient says that is too large. Then I place smaller implants until the patient is comfortable with that size.</p><p>I then add an additional 50 cc to make up for the empty parts of the bra. So if she chooses a 300 cc implant I recommend a 350 cc implant, 500 cc a 550 cc implant etc. I do certainly measure the woman’s breast diameter and check to make sure the base diameter of the implant the patient has chosen is with in these dimensions. If a woman is having difficulty choosing between two different sizes I recommend that she choose the larger implant. This is because the patients come back wishing they were a little larger and almost never smaller.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4438" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Using this method essentially all my patients are happy with their breast size. I can’t remember the last time one of my patients has expressed dissatisfaction with their size. On the other hand i not infrequently see patients from other plastic surgeons who report that their Plastic Surgeon did not let them choose their size but told them what would be best for them. The result being that I am seeing them because they are not happy with their size. I believe it is important to listen to the patient and allow them to express their desire for the appropriate size of their breast to fulfill their body image. (Carl W. Rick Lentz III, MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4439" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-616770de351ecbe132babf5831dfd60f">

</div><p>I like patients to do a “baggy test” at home once we have decided on the approximate range of implants. This often falls in line with what we discussed in the office, and allows the patient to get a rough idea of he volume that they want. (Steven Wallach, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I used to do it as your surgeon does it. However, since patients have tried sizing with implants and a sports bra in my office, I think the patients are happier with the end result. After surgery I hear “this is exactly what I wanted” more often. It isn’t exact since the body hides the implants a bit, so you may have to add some to the estimate, but it’s better than using cup size, guessing or looking at photos, which are 2 dimensional representations. It does take a lot more time with the patient. You can try the rice test. There are sizing kits available, too. (Victor Au, MD, Chapel Hill Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4440" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Unfortunately, implant sizing is not like trying on a pair of shoes. That is, the patient is not the one in the position to make the determination.</p><p>This is a normal approach and you could go with this surgeon that will use his/her best judgment. Or you could go to someone who cater to your desires.</p><p>The down side there (done all the time) is you get implants that are not the best size given your body’s dimensions and tissue characteristics. (Michael Hueneke, MD, Nashville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>there are a variety of ways to evaluate what size implant may be what you are looking for. I disagree about leaving this number up to the patient, however.</p><p>Personally, I find sizing of the implants in the office somewhat helpful for the patient and even more so for me.</p><p>I tell the patient that this only helps focus on a general range of a few implants which can be further refined intra-operatively.</p><p>Sometimes I will go larger; other times smaller; and sometimes I will use another profile implant.</p><p>If you feel comfortable with your surgeon and feels that he understands what you want, then go with him. (Steven Turkeltaub, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Choosing breast implant size is difficult. I personally use a combination of photos that a patient brings to me (of what they want to look like), 3D imaging to simulate augmentation results, and trying on actual implants. Using these methods, I think I can accurately select implant size that meets the desires of my patients. Yes, trying on implants can be imprecise.</p><p>But only to the inexperienced. I have done enough augmentations to know how implants look different when they are placed inside the body as compared to just inside a bra. In my opinion, not using implants to help make this decision is a huge oversight on your surgeon’s part. (Matthew Schulman, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Should I try on implants before breast augmentation?</h3><p>If you would like to try on different sizes to see what they look like on you before committing to a set of implants, then you should! (Steve Laverson, MD, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Should implants sizes be used prior to breast augmentation?</h3><p>Choosing the proper breast implant size is multifaceted. It includes the cup size desire of the patient, the patients’s physical dimensions, patient’s vocation, photos that the patients provides, before and after photos shown by the surgeon, and finally the recommendation of the plastic surgeon. The need to try on implant sizes is optional and can be unreliable. I don’t feel that trying on sizes is helpful and don’t use it in my practice.</p><p>Ultimately after expressing your goal with your surgeon you should follow his( her) recommendation. (George Lefkovits, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I keep sizes of all silicone implants in my office for patients to try on with a bra in consultation. Many of my patients bring in different shirts or sweaters to experiment with as well.</p><p>I find this the best teaching tool when helping to size a patient. Photos can be helpful as well but in my experience trying on the implants is the most important. I do not recommend rice or water bags because they have no specific shape.</p><p>Todays implants have very specific shape and size characteristics. A 300 cc low profile implant will look very different than a 300cc high or moderate profile implant and a 300 cc bag of rice or water will not show this difference.</p><p>I feel that sizing with the actual implants that will eventually be in your body makes sense and it gives my patients the opportunity to be an integral part of the sizing process. (Adam Tattelbaum, MD, Washington DC Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Trying on implant sizes prior to surgery in the office in most patients does not give an accurate impression of what that size of implant will look like once it is in the actual breast pocket.</p><p>I think looking at pictures is the best way for the surgeon to know what result you are wanting and then the burden is on the surgeon to deliver that result.</p><p>Using a temporary sizer in the actual implant pocket will then allow the selection of the correct implant. I personally think the only reason for a surgeon to have you try various implants and then have you pick is to shift that burden to you. If a surgeon does this and has you select the implant to be used I would suggest you find another surgeon. (Gary Hall, MD, Kansas City Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Selecting implant size for breast augmentation</h3><p>Each doctor can have a different way of helping you decide on implant size. While many surgeons use the “try implants on” technique, it does have its own set of drawbacks. Some surgeons use sizers, pictures and some use 3D computer simulation and imaging.</p><p>The most important thing above all of this is that you and your surgeon are on the same page about what you want for you, not what the surgeon wants you to have. If you have done a good job of communicating what you want. And you feel your surgeon has done a good job of listening to you and understands what you want. Then I wouldn’t be too worried. (J. Jason Wendel, MD, FACS, Nashville Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Implant Size and Fitting</h3><p>Different plastic surgeons have different ways of getting the size of breast implants right, which means, there’s no one right way to do it. In our office we ususally discuss the matter, identifying the patient’s goals, but we also give different sized implants to try on under a shirt or blouse.</p><p>Not all plastic surgeons have the capacity for 3D imaging, so that’s definitely not a standard of care. And after all, final judgement must be reserved for the OR, as different situations may call for a change in the plan. If your surgeon is a Board-certified plastic surgeon, and you trust him to do a good job, then you have nothing to worry about. (Daniel Kaufman, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Trying Implant Sizes</h3><p>In our office we have patients use the VECTRA 3D simulation photo machine which allows us to show them in 3D what their breasts with look like with different size implants. The machine takes pictures of the patient and then uses the manufacturers sizes to morph the patient’s own picture to show them the results with various implants. We then also have the patient try various size implants in their bra to make sure they understand what the added weight and volume will feel like. If patients are unsure, we have them come back a second time to repeat the process to ensure they are comfortable with their decision on implants size. (David Shafer, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Bottom line is if you aren’t comfortable with this sizing method, mention it to your surgeon. If you two can’t come to some agreement that makes you comfortable, you may need to delay your surgery until you can work it out. (Brian K. Brzowski, MD, Ogden Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Implant Sizing Prior to Surgery</h3><p>Clearly there are a number of different approaches that can get you a good result. I find that trying on a various implant sizes before surgery is a very effective way to pick your implant. It will not tell you what your final result will look like, but it works well in terms of choosing your implant size. Photos can be very misleading.</p><p>The same size implant will look different on each person depending on height, weight, waist size, chest circumference, shoulder width, etc. Even if you look at hundreds of photos it will almost be impossible to find someone who exactly matches your breast and body characteristics, so seeing a result you like does not mean that the same implant will look as good on you.</p><p>Also remember that cup size is unpredictabel and can vary according to bra manufacturer and chest circumference, so don’t get overly focused on cup size. Choose a size that feels comfortable for you. The “try-on” activity engages you in the process and I find that patients like to be involved on choosing their implant. (Braden C. Stridde, MD, Kirkland Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Trying on implants for size</h3><p>While there are many methods that allow both the patient and the surgeon to approximate what implant volume will deliver the desired outcome, it ultimately becomes the judgement and experience of the plastic surgeon and the thorough communication he or she has with the patient that is the most important factor.</p><p>I have my patients try on an implant to determine what range of sizes will make the patient happy. If the patient is deciding between two sizes, I ask the patient to choose the larger size. If a patient really feels one implant is too large, I have them decide on two smaller sizes. (Tito Vasquez, MD, FACS, Southport Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Sizing with implants prior to surgery is helpful</h3><p>I like to talk to patients about what they like and the bra size they want to be prior to surgery. None of this is very concrete or exact so I have a patient show me what size they like by trying on implants. When a patient shows me what they like, I don’t have to read their mind.</p><p>After I see what they are talking about it makes me more comfortable that the patient will get what they want. I have found this to be very reliable with lots of satisfied patients. I have also heard of surgeons like yours that also have many satisfied patients so there is no right way to do preoperative sizing.</p><p>Make sure you are comfortable that you have clearly communicated your needs with your surgeon. (Marcus L. Peterson, MD, Saint George Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I believe my patients know what they want to look like when the surgery is done. Showing me pictures (I have them look through my models) gives me a good visual confirmation of this. Also, if their pictures seem unreasonable or not consistent with their body, then we can discuss that before surgery. Stuffing sizers into a bra is an unrealistic guide in choosing implant size. Using breast implant sizers inside the pocket during surgery is a much better technique and it makes use of the patient’s chest wall shape, the muscles, skin stretchability, nipple position and other characteristic unique to them. (William H. Gorman, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I do not have my patients “try on” the implants as this is not a good representation of how they will look on you once the implants are placed behind your muscle. In choosing implant sizes for my patients we use breast measurements, patients current cup size and patients ideal cup size. With that being said we also go to the operating room with several different sizes within an agreed upon range.</p><p>We have sterile sizers in the operating room and we try all sizes within the range picked for the patient until we get the best match that looks good on the patient, fits within the patients anatomy and gives the best result to meet the patients expectations. (Renato Saltz, MD, Salt Lake City Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Trying on Implants Prior to Surgery</h3><p>I offer three options for sizing my patients:</p><ol>
<li>I show them pictures</li>
<li>I have them try on different sized implants</li>
<li>And we do Vectra 3-D imaging Personally, I wouldn’t be comfortable not allowing my patients to try on implants because each patient is different and have their own view on how they want to look. (Jeffrey Hartog, MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ol><h3>Breast implant sizers</h3><p>There is no excuse for not trying on sizers. Although I’m pretty good at determining what size implants will make a patient proportionate, occasionally I do get surprised. I have all of my patients wear a sports bra to their pre-op appointment. At that time we’ll try on sizers until we agree that we’ve chosen the correct size. A sports bra with implants is a good approximation of the postoperative breast size. You need to see what the end result will be.</p><p>And your doctor is awfully arrogant thinking that he’ll get it right every time. When my patient try on the sizers I deliberately do not tell them the size of the implant because patients often get hung up on the actual cc’s. With my approach we decide on what looks good not on how big the implants are. I recommend you seek a physician that works with you and will correctly fit you for implants. (Christopher L. Hess, MD, Fairfax Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Choosing breast implants</h3><p>There is no one way to choose breast implants but certainly they must match your base width well and be of a profile to give the look you want.</p><p>There are too many factors to consider for this answer but for the last few years I have been using <strong>breast implant sizers</strong> perop just to simulate the possible result and wouldn’t go back to when I didn’t do this. But not right or wrong either way. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
