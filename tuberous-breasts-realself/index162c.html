</div><p>Breast augmentation can certainly help, but should be carefully done with some additional soft tissue manipulation techniques by an experienced surgeon. (William T. Stoeckel, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You do appear to have mildly tuberous breasts. This means you have a narrow breast base width and a somewhat conical breast shape. Implants would “round out” the breasts. (Carmen Kavali, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tuberous breast deformity realself</h3><p>You have a very mild form of tuberous breast deformity Realself. However, if you desire breast implants we can only offer saline implants, not silicone. For some unknown reason, when silicone implants were released back onto the market place in 2006, the FDA restricted their use to women age 22 and older.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2893" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>Therefore, if you desire silicone implants you will need to wait a couple of years. If you are not interested in increasing your size then I would not recommend implants. Your shape is very close to a normal pre pregnancy appearance and your size looks nice for your body build. I would encourage you to wait until after children and breast feeding (if you choose) to see if you need some enhancement. (David Finkle, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Tuberous breasts yes , you have a modest version narrow base large protruding areola lt more than rt side an implant and areola reduction would help (Jed H. Horowitz, MD, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You may have a mild form especially on the left. Breast augmentation with some internal shaping of the breast tissue would improve your breast size and shape. (Earl Stephenson, Jr., MD, DDS, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Mild tuberous breasts</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2894" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>You have some features of tuberous breasts. Your situation could be improved by implants. Because your condition is mild, you do not need more extensive reshaping of the breasts which would require additional scarring. Your surgeon may consider placing the implants above the muscle to correct your problem. (Shim Ching, MD, Honolulu Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You have a short distance from the nipple to the inframammary fold. The breasts appear dense. The nipple arolar regions do not appear herniated. I would describe these breasts as constricted more than tubuerous. Implant surgery in constricted breasts, especially dense breasts in young women who have not had children and breast fed, can lead to a double bubble deformity. (Daniel Del Vecchio, MD, Boston Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2895" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-370eebd5cd2867caf195e5e39bee18dd">

</div><p>If you do have the tuberous breast deformity it is not clearly evident in these photographs and it is very mild (Norman Bakshandeh, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tuberous breasts?</h3><p>You may have a mild form of tuberous breasts that could be amenable to implant surgery if you desire. (Steven Wallach, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It appears that you have tuberous breasts. Breasts augmentation with some variation may result in very satisfactory improvement. The size would be deterrmined at time of consultation. I suggest that you seek consultation with a Board Certified plastic surgeon to fully discuss the intricacies of tuberous breast augmentation. (George Lefkovits, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You exhibit characteristics consistent with a mild case of Tuberous Breasts on Realself. I would recommend an areola approach with reduction of NAC and Breast Augmentation.</p><p>Without measurements it is difficult to recommend implant size and profile. You have what appears to be a wide separation of the breasts which may be difficult to totally correct.</p><p>Consult with a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon. (Todd B. Koch, MD, Buffalo Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The breasts have elements of constriction and there is a relatively wide space between the breasts, but your breasts do not meet all of the elements of a tuberous breast. Breast augmentation can certainly increase the size of the breasts and the shape can be modified to some extent during the augmentation. (Kenneth B. Hughes, MD, )</p><p>I would consider your breast as with constricted lower pole rather tuberous. A plastic surgeon can recommend you what to do.</p><p>This can be managed with a combination of implants, scoring of the gland or fat grafting. (Jesus Benito-Ruiz, MD, Spain Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast augmentation can provide tuberous breasts correction</h3><p>Although you may have a very mild component of tuberous breast deformity a breast augmentation alone may provide a very nice result. Your plastic surgeon may choose to score some of the breast tissue in the lower pole however I suspect that this will not be needed and more or less a standard type of breast augmentation can be done to help you achieve the look that you are searching for. (Remus Repta, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Technically it appears that you have a constricted breast, but not a tuberous breast. Your overall shape is actually good, but the lower pole is tight. I think you would be an excellent candidate for an augmentation. The lower pole can be internally scored and allow it to open up and round out some. Be careful not to choose too large an implant. As implant volumes increase, so do their dimensions. If the diameter of the implant is too great then too much of it will “ride up” in the upper pole and the implants will sit too high. There is only so much give that the lower pole will have as a result of the constriction. Also there is a relatively wide distance between your breasts. This will limit how close together the implants can sit. These are issues your plastic surgeon will be better able to show you while examining you. I think you will do great. (M. Scott Haydon, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Your breasts do demonstrate some of the characteristics typically seen with constricted/tuberous breasts. I would say that these features are relatively mild in your case. Generally speaking, some of the characteristics seen with tuberous breasts include a very narrow base, short distance from areola to inframammary fold, tight (constricted) lower pole of the breasts, relatively wide space between the breasts, “puffy” and areola and some degree of ptosis (drooping). In your case, I think that breast augmentation surgery alone will suffice to “Improve” the breast shape, size, distance between the breasts… much of what should be done will depend on exactly what your goals are. At this point, I would suggest ( when your life circumstances “allow”), that you meet with well experienced board certified plastic surgeons who can demonstrate significant experience helping patients in your situation. Ask to see lots of examples of their work and communicate with other patients who have had similar operations performed. Communicate your goals carefully with your plastic surgeon; in my practice I prefer the use of goal pictures to help with this communication process. (Tom J. Pousti, MD, FACS, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I agree that you have what would be considered a very mild tuberous or constricted breast. Other than what has been mentioned about some additional internal scoring to allow lower breast fullness if you chose to have a breast augmentation.</p><p>I would recommend you seek consultation with a board-certified plastic surgeon who can meet with you, discuss your desires and after examining you tell you what they would recommend. I wish you well. (Michael C. Edwards, MD, FACS, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Do I Have Tuberous Breasts?</h3><p>You have what appears to be a very moderate form of tuberous breasts. You can get a fuller shape with an augmentation and smaller areolae with a periareolar reduction if that is important to you. (Ronald V. DeMars, MD, Portland Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You do look to have characteristics consistent with mild tuberous breasts. A circumareolar approach with augmentation and internal scoring of the breast tissue to help expand the lower pole should help you achieve a nice result. (David Shafer, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I agree with my colleagues that you have some of the characteristics of mild tuberous breasts realself. However, I believe that your anatomy is perfectly acceptable for beautiful potential improvements via submuscular augmentation mammoplasty using the latest generation of cohesive smooth round silicone gel implants – final size and implant profile to be determined based on examination and your goals.</p><p>See one or more ABPS-certified plastic surgeons in your area and see what they say after physical examination. I think you will be favorably surprised at what might be achieved. (Richard H. Tholen, MD, FACS, Minneapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
