The diameter of your breasts will determine the ideal implant. Based on that a lift may be necessary, but just around the areola if necessary.

</div><p>Your nipples seem to be right at your inframammary fold. If you would like to avoid the lift and scars, then I would probably recommend a dual plane augmentation which would also maximize soft tissue coverage of your implant. If you want to go for maximal perkiness and don’t mind the scars, then a small lift could maximize the shape and nipple position. Most of my patients do the dual plane only and then can add a little lift months or years later if needed. (Scott W. Vann, MD, FACS, Savannah Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It appears that you will need either a lift with a submuscular/dual plane implant, a DD cup size implant without a lift, or an anatomic shaped implant placed above the muscle. The best option in my opinion is to get the lift. (Kenneth R.

</div><p>It appears that you have some degree of sagging. You are borderline for a mastopexy (breast lift). You probably will achieve a good look that you will be pleased with by having a silicone gel breast augmentation over the muscle – if you proceed without a lift. (Thomas Trevisani, Sr., MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Its hard to say based on photographs alone, but you have tissue deflation and in many cases your tissue will slide over an implant if an augmentation alone is done. A dual plane procedure vs. an augmentation combined with a breast lift are your best options. An in-person consultation is best before making a final decision. (Thomas A. Pane, MD, Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4450" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>You seem to be a good candidate for breast augmentation. It seems based on you pictures the majority of you breast will be comprised of an implant for the size that you desire. For that reason the silicone implant would be more appropriate. You would need to be evaluated in person to discuss the possibility of having to Implants alone or possibly a periareolar lift. (Kevin Tehrani, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>An in person exam is necessary for a proper answer. Based on your photos you are borderline needing a lift.You have primarily glandular ptosis and the nipple appears to be at the inframammary fold. A dual plane breast augmentation alone may be all that you need. You might be able to procede with the augment with the awareness that you may need a lift as a second procedure 3-6 months later.

</div><p>Sure, if you want to go bigger an implant can achieve that. You’re right that it will need to go under the muscle. Your breasts don’t look droopy, looking at your photos and an implant alone might be enough to achieve the look you want.</p><p>My advice would be to get a reputable board-certified plastic surgeon to assess your breasts and talk you through your choices. You should get a great result, from a breast augmentation from what I can see.

</div><p>The key to whether you need a lift depends on the degree of drooping which in your case is not too bad , as well as the degree of skin laxity. You can’t tell skin laxity from the photograph. Presuming that your skin quality is good you are in what I call the grays zone. You may be able to do without a lift depending upon the size of the implant you choose and the tolerance for some degree of residual laxity.</p><p>I do not mind a small degree of residual laxity even after augmentation. I think it actually makes the breast look more natural. I find that many patients would prefer to avoid a lift if possible.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4456" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>In my own practice when patients are in the gray zone provided their skin quality is good and they choose an appropriate size implant we will sometimes take the route of placing the implant, allowing it to drop and settle, and then deciding whether a lift will be advantageous in the future. It allows patients to be part of the decision-making process. If you take that route you must be patient because not all the droop is filled out immediately. It really takes about 12 weeks before you see how well the implant alone has done. A lift can always be added, but it cannot be taken away. A board-certified plastic surgeon. Will be able to give you better guidance after being able to examine you. (Adam Tattelbaum, MD, )</p><h3>Do I need a lift along with implants?</h3><p>You will get a pleasing result with breast augmentation alone, as long as your nipples are not below the level of your inframammary folds.</p><p>This would appear to be the case based on what I can see on your photos.</p><p>I recommend silicone gel implants as they ripple far less than saline devices, last longer and are lighter. (Eric Pugash, MD, Vancouver Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It appears from your pictures that a lift will be needed once the implants are placed. The amount of lift needed will depend on the implant size you pick.</p><p>I agree with submuscular placement and I would recommend silicone implants for the best look and feel. A consult with a board certified plastic surgeon is the next step. (Mark Deutsch, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>From your pictures you appear to be small A cup and your nipples are at the level of the IMF ( infra mammary fold ) or slightly above it. In my, over 27 years of practice, I noticed that many women over estimate their breasts size, mainly because ‘Victoria secrets’ makes the bra size smaller, so women feel better about their breasts size.</p><p>To become a 32 D cup, you will need implants with a volume of, roughly, 425 cc. As far as the lift, it depends on you goal. Since you mentioned that you want your breasts riding high, a mini lift procedure , done at the same time of the augmentation, will help to achieve that goal. However, you can get a very nice result with just augmentation, though the IMF will have to be lowered further , in order to give you perky breasts.</p><p>Always, consult with board certified plastic surgeons who perform surgery in accredited surgery center for your safety. Most importantly, check the before and after pictures to make sure that they are numerous, consistent and attractive. Check also the ‘realself’ reviews for positive patients experience which provides important information on the surgeons. (Shlomo Widder, MD, McLean Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Augmentation</h3><p>It is hard to tell with just photos. The quality of your skin is important. If it has significant stretch in the lower pole the implants may be a bit low for your tastes with just an augmentation. If you would be happy with the implant centered roughly where your areola and nipple sit now, then just go with the augmentation. Due to skin quality, I would not go too large to avoid recurrent ptosis. (John Michael Thomassen, MD, Fort Lauderdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>YOu probably do need a lift or if not now at some point. The issue is obviously the scars of a lift and whether now is the right time for you.</p><p>Anatomical implants will help to elevate the nipple somewhat especially if the most projected implants are used. This may well give you a satisfactory lift on its own without the scars required for a mastopexy.</p><p>Both give different results and you need to consult with a PS who can show you examples of his/her work so that you can make an informed decision as to how to proceed. (Gary L. Ross, MBChB, FRCS, Manchester Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Appears as the normal post part breasts. If OK with you a larger implant silicone UHP is what I recommend, like 500 cc+. As for lifting, maybe but I might offer that as a secondary operation ‘if needed’. (Darryl J. Blinski, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>While an actual exam would be necessary for a final determination, it appears from your photos that you would benefit from a lift with your implants to get the best result. There seems to be sufficient skin laxity that an augmentation alone would not correct. While placement of a large implant can be done in an effort to fill the over stretched skin, this is often a poor long term solution, and can lead to bottoming out and additional sagging over time. In my estimation, the best result would likely be obtained by adding a lift to the augmentation. There are a variety of different lifting procedures, and the options can be discussed with your plastic surgeon during your consultation. I agree with the submuscular placement of the implant, as it will create a more natural look and feel. (Jeffrey Rockmore, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Based on your 2 front images it appears a breast lift plus implants would resolve your issue of deflated droopy breasts. Without a lift you will end of with droopy large breasts. However looking at your side profile it may appear a large implants correctly placed will allow you to achieve a fuller breast.</p><p>You may decide to have an augmentation alone and then depending on the results and your level of satisfaction a lift can always be added later down the track. And so on this note l would advise only an in person consult with a Board certified plastic surgeon to discuss these options and advise you on the best avenue. (Benjamin Norris, MbCHb, FRACS(Plast), Sydney Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Lift with implants?</h3><p>I think that if you proceed with augmentation only, a large enough implant will re-inflate the breast tissue and give you the results you are looking for without any incisions on your breast. (Ron Hazani, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
