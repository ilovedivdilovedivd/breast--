</div><p>At the earliest signs of capsular contracture, patients should try to see their plastic surgeon to discuss these options. (Richard J. Bruneteau, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Possible capsular contracture</h3><p>If your breasts are firm then this had been changing and getting worse then this is definitely a capsular contracture. On examination a plastic surgeon will be able to diagnose a capsular contracture and determine if a surgical correction is indicated. (Richard Bloom, MBBS, FRACS, Melbourne Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Signs of capsular contracture after breast augmentation</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1108" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>Signs of capsular contracture is diagnosed by your surgeon based on his examination of your breasts. A capsular contracture usually presents with an increased firmness of the breast or a change in shape.</p><p>Typically, the breasts appear smaller and more narrow, and are both higher and more projecting. This can progress and worsen over time. While capsular contractures are less common with newer implants, they do still occur.</p><p>The treatment of a capsular contracture depends on is severity. There are oral medications that have shown some limited effectiveness in the treatment of a mild contracture. The hallmark of treatment is release or removal of the capsule. This can be a relatively brief procedure in most cases. Unfortunately, the possibility of a recurrence, though this can be greatly reduced now by the use of acellular dermal matrices. Based on your description, it does sound like a capsular contracture may be what you have.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1111" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I would suggest an evaluation with a board certified plastic surgeon for verification and a discussion about treatment options. (Jeffrey Rockmore, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Capsular contracture is the number one reason that breast enhancement patients may wind up needing additional surgery in the future. Your body will naturally form a layer of protective scar tissue around the implant following breast augmentation. If this layer of scar tissue becomes thickened, it may result in a harder and differently-shaped breast. This is called capsular contracture. See your surgeon to see if this is indeed what you have. Jeffrey Rockmore, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Capsular Contracture after Breast Augmentation</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1109" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Most likely with 10 year old implants the firmness you are feeling is from capsular contracture. Capsular contracture is scar tissue that forms around the breast implant. All patients have scar tissue around their breast implants but when the scar tissue becomes too thick or contracts, it becomes firm and can become a problem. A doctor can determine if a patient has capsular contracture by an examination. (J. Timothy Katzen, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You give a very good story for capsular contracture. You have had the implants in a while. They got harder and are sticking out more. Best to see a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon. They will be able to guide you as to what comes next. (Richard J. Bruneteau, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1112" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Your changes in appearance and firmness are characteristic of capsular contracture. With capsular contracture, the implants become more ball-like in shape. (Their original shape is more like a disc). This is due to the physics of a flexible three-dimensional object.</p><p>The shape with the smallest surface area is a ball, and with capsular contracture, the surface area is reduced, forcing the implant into a ball shape. The rate of capsular contracture increases with time, especially with silicone implants, because there is some degradation of the silicone gel, which can cause inflammation that results in contracture. The implants will also feel harder. (Jerome Edelstein, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast firmness may be a symptom of an early capsular contracture but not always.</h3><p>There are many causes of a breast that becomes firmer with age. It can be related to tightening of the pocket around the implant (known as a capsular contracture – CC) or it can be related to changes in natural breast tissue volume.</p><p>If you have seen an increase in breast size / bra cup over the last 10 years it may be an increase in the breast volume which can make the breast feel firmer.</p><p>This is not a concern and is not related to the implant or surrounding implant pocket. As you may know implants themselves do not get more firm with time.</p><p>The pocket that surrounds the implant can tighten with time. This is known as capsular contracture. There are four grades of capsular contracture from grade I to grade IV. A grade I is a normal, soft, fully mobile implant that looks completely natural. A grade IV capsule is a firm, tender, hard implant capsule that distorts the implant and the overlying breast shape.</p><p>It would be best to see a plastic surgeon to have an examination done for an opinion. There are many options that will soften an early capsule including movement exercises and medications. Later grades of capsule formation can be treated surgically with a brief operation to restore your beautiful breast shape, form and natural feel. (James C. Pietraszek, MD, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Diagnosis of Capsular Contracture after Breast Augmentation</h3><p>Although capsular contractures following breast augmentation can occur just about anytime, most women start having symptoms around three or more months to several years after their breast implant surgery. Therefore your symptoms may be compatible with this diagnosis. It might also mean that you have a ruptured implant if silicone.</p><p>The diagnosis of capsular contracture is made by History and Physical exam. Signs and symptoms of a capsular contracture are going from a soft breast in good position to a hard one that looks hard and round like a ball, usually tends to ride up your chest and can eventually be painful.(i.e. hard, deformed, displaced) (Raj S. Ambay, MD, Brandon Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Increased firmness after 10 years is a symptom of capsular contracture. It would be adviseable to see a board certified plastic surgeon (preferably your implanting surgeon) who can utilize history and physical examination to diagnose capsular contracture. (Raj S. Ambay, MD, Brandon Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Symptoms of Capsular Contracture After Breast Augmentation?</h3><p>Without examining you it is somewhat difficult to give you a complete diagnosis. I would suspect if your implants feel firmer, you may have developed some capsular contracture. If you have a silicone gel implant, this may indicate a symptom of leakage. The free silicone can irritate the capsule and cause thickening over time. I would recommend seeing a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon for a proper evaluation. (Edwin C. Pound, III, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breasts firm- capsule contracture?</h3><p>It sounds like you do indeed have capsule contracture. Implants do not get hard. The hardness is the pocket around the implant changing and getting smaller and squeezing the implant, limiting movement and looking and feeling unnatural. Opening the pocket and freeing the implant can solve these issues although there may be recurrence. (Edwin C. Pound, III, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Capsular contraction after breast augmentation symptoms</h3><p>A change in firmness as well as appearance 10 years out from having breast augmentation is suggestive that you may be forming a capsular contraction.</p><p>Sometimes this progresses to the point of being painful. I would recommend making an appointment with your plastic surgeon and getting them to examine you.</p><p>If you have a capsular contraction the treatment is often removal of the implants, as well as removal of the old capsules or “opening” of the capsule depending on the thickness and character of the capsule. This is also followed with replacement of a new set of breast implants. (James F. Boynton, MD, FACS, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Capsular contracture breast augmentation occurs when scar tissue forms around the breast implant.</p><p>It is normal to form a small amount of scar tissue around the breast implant.</p><p>When someone forms too much scar tissue, a capsular contracture is the result. There are different grades of capsular contracture. The scar tissue can cause the breast to become hard, painful and irregularly shaped.</p><p>The scar tissue changes the shape of the implant. A board certified plastic surgeon will be able to determine the grade of your capsule based on the appearance and shape of your breast and recommend the best treatment to correct the capsule. (Scott Haupt, MD, Salt Lake City Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Capsular contracture breast augmentation</strong> is not an uncommon occurrence after breast augmentation. When an implant is inserted either above or below the muscle the body naturally produces scar tissue which envelops the implant. This is called the capsule and is a normal part of healing.</p><p>Abnormal scar tissue development can result in many findings on physical examination which would include hardness, changes in implant or breast shape, changes in implant position, pain, tenderness, or coolness to the touch. When the normal scar tissue capsule thickens and results in these changes a capsular contracture has occurred. This can result from both saline and silicone gel implants and also has a tendency to occur more frequently when the implants are placed above the muscle.</p><p>Although the development of a capsular contracture breast augmentation can occur in any patient with implants, it can also be a sign of an implant disruption especially in silicone gel devices. Current treatment of a capsular contracture involves either splitting the capsule layer (capsulotomy) or complete removal of the capsule (capsulectomy).</p><p>The use of external manipulation of the implant through firm pressure (closed capsulotomy) is no longer currently recommended. I would suggest that you are evaluated by a board-certified plastic surgeon where further evaluation, including a possible mammogram or MRI, can be undertaken. (Christopher J. Morea, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Signs of capsular contracture breast augmentation</h3><p>What you describe could certainly be early signs of capsule contracture. Capsule contracture is the process where the scar tissue that formed around the implant, the capsule, shrinks.</p><p>At first the implant might feel just a bit more firm, or not move as well as it did. As it prgresses the contracture will make the breast look more round and possibly ball shaped. It can also fell harder.</p><p>Sometimes you can reverse the process with high doses of Vitamin E and massage. There are also some medications that can be tried but you need to be closely monitored by a Plastic surgeon.</p><p>Also, sometimes the late development of capsular contracture breast augmentation can signal that the implant has ruptured. In any case, if your condition is changing it might be worth your while to see a Plastic surgeon jut to get hte best information. (Christopher J. Morea, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Capsular contracture breast augmentation can occur months to years after surgery. This Is Due to the Body Forming Hard Tissue Around the Implant. It Is Recommend That You Follow up with Your Doctor to Determine the Treatment of This Problem. (Melek Kayser, MD, Detroit Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Breast implants do not harden over time. They develop capsular contracture.</p><p>The scar tissue around the implant starts to contract hardening the entire implant, changing it’s shape, and potential moving the implant (usually upward).</p><p>To determine if you have a capsular contracture your plastic surgeon will look for changes in breast shape, position and for the softness/hardness of the breast implant.</p><p>The treatment is to release the scar but very often if a release is the only thing done, the contracture will recur.</p><p>For that reason we try to reposition the implant into a new pocket, minimize surgical bleeding, and avoid potential contamination. (Rod J. Rohrich, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>What is capsular contracture in breast implants</h3><p>Everyone forms a capsule around their implant. This is no problem when this capsule remains thin and soft. This problem of capsular contracture is a pathologic process where this capsule becomes hardened, thickened and calcified.</p><p>Patients experience capsular contracture experience a hardening of their implant/breast, distortion of their breast shape/position, and in severe cases, breast pain. (Rod J. Rohrich, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How to tell if you are having a capsular contracture in breast implants</h3><p>Any time you implant a foreign body into a human, the body surrounds the foreign body with a thin layer of scar tissue called a capsule. </p><p>Ordinarily, the scar tissue around a breast implant is thin and doesn’t pose any problem, but if it is stimulated, possibly by a low grade infection, it may thicken and contract.</p><p>As the shape that results when you try to minimize the surface area containing a given volume is a sphere, a breast undergoing capsule contracture will become more spherical. The breast may seem to become rounder, firmer, higher and occasionally tender.</p><p>See your plastic surgeon if you suspect a capsular contracture in breast implants. (Martin Jugenburg, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Is it a capsule?</h3><p>If they feel abnormally firm, most likely the implants are encapsulated. Encapsulated implants will feel very distinct from the surrounding breast tissue, are usually firmly attached to the chest wall, and the breast tissue will sometimes hang off the implants. Obviously the best way is to be examined by a board certified plastic surgeon, with experience in treating capsular contractures. (Martin Jugenburg, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Capsular contracture in breast implants</h3><p>This is, by far, the greatest risk of having implants. Saline breast implants, though ten years old, should be as soft as the day you received them </p><p>Breast hardening or distortion may be signs of capsular contracture in breast implants.</p><p>Your physician, by exam can determine whether you have capsular contracture in breast implants by the look and feel of your implants. Some women require a surgical excision of capsular tissue (capsulectomy). (C. Bob Basu, MD, FACS, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Firmness of the breast after augmentation is capsular contracture.</h3><p>Implants, themselves, do not harden. The firmness you describe is the capsule shrinking in surface area and squeezing the fluid inside the prosthesis. This makes it feel firm. It is not a health problem but you might want to visit your surgeon at a convenient time to discuss your options. (C. Bob Basu, MD, FACS)</p></div>
