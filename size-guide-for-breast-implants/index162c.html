The cup size itself will vary from manufacturer to manufacturer as well as who is doing the actual measurements.</p><p>Thus, cup size is never a reliable indicator for your breast size. I typically encourage my patients not to communicate her desires in cup size but more on the actual look and appearance.</p><p>Good communication between you and your surgeon of your expectations is warranted – choosing your surgeon wisely is the first step.</p><p>Discussion of your wishes and having an honest and open dialog of your procedure is mandatory (e.g, implant type, incision, placement, lift, etc).</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2352" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I have found that photographs brought by the patient is helpful to get a visualization of the appearance you wish for in terms of size, shape, fullness, etc.</p><p>In addition, your surgeon’s pre and postoperative photographs should demonstrate a realistic goal for you. Once this has been accomplished, allow your surgeon to utilize his/her best medical judgment during the procedure to finesse the best possible result for you after preoperative biodimensional planning and fitting the right implant for your breast width. (Lewis Albert Andres, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I would first start with a consultation with a board certified Plastic Surgeon and convey your “dream” size to him.

</div><p>There are sizers for different breast implant capacities and they can be tried on with bras of various sizes. Once the initial size has been recommended then you can decide if that fits your “dream” size adequately. (Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Picking implants size</h3><p>I use Vectra 3D imaging for all of my patients to give them the best idea of what their result will be. Cup size is a good starting point for conversation, but varies based on bra manufacturer.</p><p>The base width of your breast is also important in choosing the right implant for you. It is best to see a board certified plastic surgeon to help make this important choice. (Grant Stevens, MD)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2354" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-5c2b43db30d37388c501e254aa351542">

</div><p>I use a patient’s breast diameter as the main determining factor to offer them a range of 3-5 implants with varying profiles. I then have them try these implants on under a special sizing bra and look in a mirror. They choose the one that appeals to them the most. Be sure to see a board certified plastic surgeon in your area to go over sizing. (Asif Pirani, MD, FRCS(C), Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Implant Size Based on Measurements</h3><p>There are many different widths and volume sizes that can be considered when choosing implants. That is why it is important for your doctor to take a measurment of the width of your breast at the breast exam. This will determine the width of the implant and from there you’ll discuss the best volume related to the desired projection and cup size. (Jeffrey W. Hall, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast implant width is the key</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2353" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Your surgeon will want to measure the base diameter of the breast. with this information, different size options can be discussed. These include moderate, moderate plus, and high profile implants.</p><p>The various cc’s of these options can be shown to you and you can simulate the implants either with sizers or using something as simple as ziploc bags of rice! get a feel for which of these options give you the desired result.</p><p>The problem is, not all “C” cups are created equally. one person’s idea of what a “C” is can be very different from another’s. use the simulation to get comfortable with a certain cc size of implant. (Eric Chang, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The best size of breast implants is the size that best fits your body. It also must take into account your body image.</p><p>You have your own unique body image. Your best size is YOUR BEST SIZE.</p><p>Regardless of A/BC/D cup, what size or what shape is best for you. In breast augmentation consultation, I discuss this with my patients.</p><p>I have them put on different sized implants under a jogging bra to give the patient the best idea of what they could potientally look like.</p><p>At least two weeks prior to the surgery, I lay out several sizes of implants and have the patients put on a jogging bra and we together select the best implant size for the patient.</p><p>The patient is not told the volume of the implant, but the patinet only comments whether or not they like/dislike their look with the implant under the jogging bra. Also, whether or not the implant is too small, too big, or just right. Like goldilocks . (Jonathan Berman, MD, Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Since you already know your desired cup size, my recommendation would be to schedule a consultation and get measured by your desired Plastic Surgeon. Your Doctor will measure your height, weight, current bra size, take the dimensions of your chest wall to give you your desired outcome. You will be able to try on sizer implants as well. (Michael A. Fiorillo, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Getting the right size – start with what feels and looks good to you</h3><p>Despite all that has been written in our specialty about the correct size implant, I do not believe that within reason there is a right and a wrong size for breasts. Some people like small breasts, others medium others extremely large.</p><p>No one has to have breast implants for larger breasts, it’s purely about what the individual wants, and what their tissues can handle. So the first thing is to try to define how you would like to look, particularly in clothes or a bikini, quite simply by adding sizer implants or measured bags of rice into your bra.</p><p>Try not to focus on actual cup size, but just on how you would like to look. Also looking at pictures, particularly before and after pictures will give you an idea of what can be achieved with implants of any given size. Particularly look at before pictures of people that have a similar build and breast size to you. Once you have that in mind, your surgeon will have a good place to start.</p><p>In our practice we start with this and then go to computer imaging to simulate the actual implant size that is likely to make you look like you want to look. The next step is to make a decision as to whether the size implant you have chosen is not too large for your body type and the thickness of your tissues.</p><p>In our practice if the size desired is larger than we think your tissues can handle, we will council you accordingly about the risks of bottoming out, sagging (ptosis) etc. We will also council you on the pros and cons of various options including saline, gel, implant profile and even fat grafting. Ultimately though it is your decision to make. (Jeffrey Hartog, MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Implant Sizing for Breast Augmentation</h3><p>There are many factors that go into the proper sizing of a breast implant. The most important one is the amount of breast tissue that the patient already has as well as the chest wall base diameter. There are other factors that can affect your ultimate breast size so that you are not out of proportion or excessively sized.</p><p>Breast implant surgery requires attention to detail, as well as objective and subjective measurements, to provide for optimal, individualized breast augmentation. However, I find the use of implant sizers placed in a bra to be very inaccurate and not helpful as they can be very misleading. (Rod J. Rohrich, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Choosing the right breast size</h3><p>The right breast implant size can be estimated by your current cup size, your desired cup size, and your height. This will give you a range to work with. The next step would be to try some implants from this range in the plastic surgeons office or the rice test. You can use different implants for each breast to make the fine volume decisions. Doing all of this will get you very, very close to the implant size that would give you the size and shape you want and really minimize the chance that you will be too big or too small. (Remus Repta, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Choosing the right size for breast implants</h3><p>Choosing the right size for your breast implants is the most important decision that YOU can make during your consultations with your PS. Then it is up to the surgeon to choose the correct implant for you based on the volume you chose, your breast size and shape. All these factors are very important for the best overall result.</p><p>Also, never choose your implants based on what “your friend got” or “what you saw online” as these are common phrases I hear. Other women that you know may have totally different breast and body characteristics and what looks good on someone else, may look terrible on you.</p><p>Spend time in your plastic surgeons office trying out implants of various sizes and bring a friend or spouse with you to have another persons’ opinion. Have fun, you will love them. (Erez Sternberg, MD, Jacksonville Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>What Size Implants Will Give Me The Look I Want?</h3><p>Well, the good news is that there is no “right” size, so you don’t have to worry about finding it! Actually, of course, there is a range of breast implants sizes that will typically provide the result the patient is looking for.</p><p>Implants don’t come in cup sizes but, instead, in cc’s, or ounces. It’s about 150-210 cc, or 5-7 ounces per bra cup size. But it’s more if you’re taller and/or have broader shoulders; less if you’re shorter and have narrower shoulders.</p><p>And that’s just the issue of the implants size; you have to look and make sure you have enough skin and tissue for the implant size you want and that it will look right on YOU. And even then there are no absolutes for what is “right,” and, of course, no guarantees that you will get exactly the result you have in mind.</p><p>It’s just not always that precise. However, following the basic rules of implant selection (take a look at my video below for a primer on the ABC’s) is a good way to start the process and become familiar with the principal things to consider. Then you have to be seen by one or more plastic surgeons to see how what you want is likely to fit into what you have! (Alan M. Engler, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Breast implant size should be determined by the natural breast width, the breast envelope and the the amount of stretch of the skin envelope.</p><p>The natural width of the breast is a good starting point followed by the characteristic of the skin envelope. These measurements let you get a starting point for implant size selection.</p><p>Physical exam at the consultation along with a sizer lets us see if the concepts fit. Cup size is difficult because depending the the company you buy the bra from can define the Cup size.</p><p>Some bras run larger than others. I prefer to talk in being proportionate for your size but full and the measurements with the sizer at the visit has really helped. (Paul Albear, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There are many things to consider when choosing an implant size. Take into account your height, frame, (width of your shoulders and chest wall), amount of breast tissue you have and how “tight” your tissues are.</p><p>A consultation with your plastic surgeon can help you determine the best size for you. In my office, I evaluate the above and I insert silicone implant sizers in a bra. I find this helps the patient visualize the potential result from the surgery.</p><p>Your plastic surgeon can tell you if the size you like is a good choice for you. I have many patients who have gone from an A cup to a C cup so this is certainly a possibility. (James H. Schmidt, MD, Sarasota Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>So, what size breast implants should i get?</h3><p>The best way to determine the appropriate size implant is through a good physical exam. The exam should include assessment of the quality of the skin and breast tissue as well as measurement of the breasts width and chest width. Dr. ES (Earl Stephenson, Jr., MD, DDS, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Picking implant size</h3><p>Number one important thing. Try them on. This gives you a good idea of what they can look like, but not a perfect idea. Take a variety of tops to try different sizes with. No one should tell you that they will make you a particular cup size since that even varies between bra manufacturers.</p><p>Less elastic around the chest allows cups to fit a wider variety of people. It is how you look, not the letter that is important. (Byron D. Poindexter, MD, Reston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Augmentation implant sizing</h3><p>I tell my patients that the most important decision they will make is the size of the implant (others being the shape or profile of the implant, and the filler/silicone or saline) We spend a lot of time sizing and encourage the patient to do some at home.</p><p>We loan out implant sizers and encourage the patient to go to a store and take many different sizes into the changing room with the sizers to think about cup size. You can make your own sizers with Flax seed or rice in panty hose (30 cc per ounce or 240 cc per cup).</p><p>We make the final decision prior to surgery so the patient is sure what she is getting. Basically use the sizers to find the look you want and then after surgery go find a bra that fits! (Terrence Murphy, MD, Englewood Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>A full C cup is very common among patients. Implant size is based on the patients height, weight, activity and most of all personal preference.</p><p>During your consultation your physician should show you pictures of women who are similar in height and weight as you, this will give you and your physician a clearer vision of how the implants may look on you.</p><p>This allows your physician to see what goal you have in mind. It is good to have a few options to look at, so I would suggest that you pick more than 1 photo out. (Chia Chi Kao, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>First you need to try on sizers to find the implants that will fit your body best.</p><p>You are the only one that determine what looks best for you. It is dependent on your perception of the way your body looks. (Gary Lawton, MD, FACS, Toledo Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In general, implant size does not correlate with bra cup size. The cup size itself will vary from manufacturer to manufacturer as well as who is doing the actual measurements.</p><p>Thus, cup size is never a reliable indicator for your breast size. I typically encourage my patients not to communicate her desires in cup size but more on the actual look and appearance. Good communication between you and your surgeon of your expectations is warranted – choosing your surgeon wisely is the first step. Discussion of your wishes and having an honest and open dialog of your procedure is mandatory (e.g, implant type, incision, placement, lift, etc).</p><p>I have found that photographs brought by the patient is helpful to get a visualization of the appearance you wish for in terms of size, shape, fullness, etc. In addition, your surgeon’s pre and postoperative photographs should demonstrate a realistic goal for you.</p><p>Once this has been accomplished, allow your surgeon to utilize his/her best medical judgment during the procedure to finesse the best possible result for you after preoperative biodimensional planning and fitting the right implant for your breast width. (Lewis Albert Andres, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Size choice is based on your dimensions and profile preferences</h3><p>The first thing you need is an excellent plastic surgeon who will listen to you and show you many pictures to help determine the look you like and how either natural or extra full you want to be. Everybody is different and the best way for me to choose an implant is to measure a patient’s base width behind the breast and find implants that match this well. Next is the profile preference each patient has.</p><p>A moderate profile implant gives a natural upper pole look while the moderate plus and high profiles look fuller in the upper pole. Finally, the height of the patient and other chest wall configurations are taken into account because of their influence on the final size. Just putting implants in your clothes or doing the rice test are very inaccurate ways of choosing an implant because they look about 20% smaller in you than they did on you. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How do I find the right size for breast augmentation</h3><p>This is probably the question that most prospective patients worry about the most. I have found that for a person with an “A” cup bra, an external sizing system works the best. I use the Mentor Corporation external anatomically-shaped sizing system and my patients love it. (They get an idea of how they will actually look in clothing and not just a computer generated image.)</p><p>Since clothing manufacturers vary in what they define as a “C” cup, I find that this system lets you as the patient define your size prior to surgery.
