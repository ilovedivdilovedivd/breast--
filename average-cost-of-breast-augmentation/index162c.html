At our facility the price for a silicone breast augmentation is about 6300.00. This price includes the surgeon’s fee, anesthesia, silicone implants, and the operating room facility. (Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Average cost of breast augmentation </strong> and other elective cosmetic procedures varies greatly with geographic location and from surgeon to surgeon. Average cost of breast augmentation in the Raleigh-Durham region of North Carolina ranges from $4500 for saline implants up to as high as $9000 for silicone gel implants.</p><p>I charge $5400 for saline and $6400 for silcone gel implants in my practice. This is assuming that a breast lift is not also necessary.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1565" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-0095078f45e7c684458ac9d7a4c8e721">

</div><p>This would include the cost of the surgery, anesthesia, OR fees, follow up visits, post operative bra, etc. (William T. Stoeckel, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How much does breast augmentation cost on average ?</h3><p>As you can see by the various responses from plastic surgeons across the country, the cost of breast augmentation varies from region to region. In our NY marketplace, the average cost of breast augmentation is $6600 for silicone implants and $6000 for saline. These fees include everything associated with the procedure, including the implants, operating room, anesthesia, and all post op care.</p><p>I would make a suggestion that cost is not the only factor in deciding where to have your augmentation done. Meet with your potential surgeon and see if you are comfortable with his/her approach. Also, look at pictures of their work.

(Naveen Somia, MBBS, PhD, FRACS, Sydney Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast augmentation prices can vary from city to city</h3><p>The price for breast augmentation varies geographically. Here in Las Vegas there are a number of skilled surgeons who perform hundreds of breast augmentations a year and our prices tend to be less than places like Beverly Hills, New York City, Seattle or San Francisco, mainly because the cost of living and doing business here is less than in those places.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1564" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I feel that patients should look for an experienced breast surgeon who listens and who you feel can give you what you want the FIRST time. I see patients every week who have paid inflated prices for “famous or celebrity” surgeons and need a revision because they did not get the breasts they wanted.</p><p>You should be able to find a reasonable price and a skilled, experienced surgeon who can deliver the results you are looking for with some research, and possibly travel to a different city where prices can be a lot less.

</div><p>The average cost of breast augmentation surgery varies from one part of the US to another. That can be very confusing for the consumer, and that is especially important in these tough economic times. The patient should know that the cost of a breast augmentation surgery is made up of cost of the implant, anaesthesia fee, facility fee, and surgeon’s fee.</p><p>These different cost factors are not the same for each practice. Augmentation is one of the most popular and desirable plastic surgery procedures, and the cost should not be the only factor you consider when making your final decision. As you do your market research, you should really focus on the, reputation, credentials, training, and outcomes of your surgeon.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1567" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-83e6c35ef7b5f8984a37bb8ce108c0bb">

</div><p>You should intrust your care to a BOARD CERTIFIED PLASTIC SURGEON, that you are most comfortable with. The cost of augmentation in our practice in Miami is $3200 for saline and $4200 for silicone. (Rami Ghurani, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast augmentation average cost</h3><p>Average cost of breast augmentation surgery can vary depending on different factors including the practice, the local market competition, and which implant is desired. Silicone gel implants tend to be about $1000 more than saline implants for the pair. Costs for the surgery can range from $3000 to $7000. Miami is a very competitive market so average prices are closer to the lower limit. In our practice, the cost is $3200 and $4200 for saline and silicone gel augmentation respectively. (Moises Salama, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There are many costs that go into the final fee for breast augmentation. My assistant takes into account the OR fee, anesthesia, the implants, and finally my fee.</p><p>I only operate in hospitals or approved surgical centers associated with hospitals with board board certified anesthesiologists so the costs are higher for that amount of safety.</p><p>My fee is based on the difficulty in reaching excellent results with what the patient is starting with preoperatively, my experience, the risks of surgery, and demand.</p><p>You should consider that shopping for the cheapest surgeon is dangerous and you may want to consider that there may be a reason why that person needs to be so cheap.</p><p>Consider doing research into the best surgeons and compair just those. You will be happier in the long run. </p><p>The answer to your question is a total fee of $6000 to $12000 for augmentation. (Jacob Freiman, MD, FACS, Miami Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Silicone implants generally cost about $1000 more than saline implants. </p><p>Costs start at about $5000 and go up from there. (Eric Chang, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The costs for Breast Augmentation being performed by surgeons with similar training and credentials and being preformed at fully accredited surgical centers is approximately $5600 with silicone implants and $4500 with saline implants. (Renato Saltz, MD, Salt Lake City Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Augmentation Costs</h3><p>When considering the cost of breast augmentation, consider the following rough cost estimates:</p><ol>
<li>Surgeon’s fees (may vary from $2000 – $5000)</li>
<li>Implant fees (may vary from $1000 – $2000) depending on saline or silicone.</li>
<li>Facility costs (may vary from $1000 – $2000)</li>
<li>Anesthesia costs (may vary from $500 – $1500)</li>
</ol><p>This should be give you the range of costs for a routine breast augmentation ($4500 – $10500). </p><p>Most estimates will be in somewhere in the middle as the range of fees are all set independently unless your surgeon has their own facility.</p><p>I work at a hospital with very reasonable facility and anesthesia fees so my costs tend to be on the lower side of the range. (Young R. Cho, MD, PhD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The fees for elective cosmetic procedures vary from city to city. It is very important to compare apples to apples though, make sure your price quotes are from only BOARD CERTIFIED PLASTIC SURGEONS. Not Cosmetic surgeons pretending to be plastic surgeons. You will want to know the following: How many BAM’s do you perform a year? Do you have privileges to perform this procedure in the hospital? Where is this procedure performed? What is the total cost – surgeon’s fee, facility fee, implant fee, anesthesia fee, prescriptions and meds, garments, post op care, photos, revision fee (if needed) What type of warranty do I get on the implants and from the surgeon? Do you offer financing and what are the terms of financing? The average cost for silicone implants is approximately $1,000 more than saline. My total cost fees are $4,700 for saline and $5,700 for silicone. (David Finkle, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The average cost of breast implant surgery is around $5, 500 for saline, and $6,400 for silicone. This price varies from office to office, and includes different items. You should call the office and get a quote, and also see if the consultation is free. (Alfred C. Speirs, MD (retired), Colorado Springs Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>We charge $5400 for breast augmentation with saline implants in Plano, Texas. The cost includes:</p><ol>
<li>Surgeon’s fee</li>
<li>M.D. anesthesiologist</li>
<li>Facility fee</li>
<li>Breast implants</li>
<li>Platinum Plus Implant Warranty</li>
<li>All routine follow-up visits (Ronald Friedman, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ol><p>There are many factors that go into the breast augmentation surgery cost.</p><p>Some of these include the amount of work anticipated for the surgery, the costs of the implants, surgery center and anesthesia.</p><p>Other factors that influence the price include the surgeon experience, how much they value their time and what the overhead is in their office.</p><p>As noted previously, this is an elective procedure and not something you want to shave too many points on.</p><p>You don’t want to find someone who underbids the job then cuts corners to make a profit. (Barry Stuart Handler, MD, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Breast augmentation surgery cost</strong> including the costs for the operating room, surgeon, anesthesia, breast implants, and all office visits is $3900 for Saline Implants for all realself visitors. To learn more visit our website below. (Ankit Desai, MD, Jacksonville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Ask your surgeon :</p><ol>
<li>Are you Board Certified?</li>
<li>In what are you Board Certified? (Correct answers are : American Board of Surgery and/or American Board of Plastic Surgery). These are the only Boards within the umbrella of the American Board of Medical Specialties.</li>
<li>Do you perform Breast Surgery? How often and how many.is it your special interest?</li>
<li>Can I see your work? (John Philip Connors III, MD, FACS, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ol><h3>The Average Cost of breast augmentation surgery depends on several factors.</h3><p>Breast augmentation surgery cost depends on several factors.</p><ol>
<li>Geographic location: some areas cost more than others. Here in Utah I have a high percentage of patients that fly in, stay for 3-5 days in a hotel, fly home and still save a couple of thousand dollars over what they would pay at home.</li>
<li>Saline vs silicone: saline implants cost about $1000 less than silicone</li>
<li>Whether or not you pay for revision surgery: you should find out before who pays for revisions.</li>
<li>Find out if the cost includes the operating room, anesthesia, medications, bras, bandages etc.</li>
<li>Experience of the surgeon. Overall you can expect to pay somewhere between $3500 – $5500 for saline and about $1000 more for silicone. (Richard H. Fryer, MD, Salt Lake City Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ol><p>There are 3 factors that add up to the total cost of a breast augmentation surgery:</p><ol>
<li>Surgeon’s fee for operating</li>
<li>Implant cost (silicone cost more than saline implants)</li>
<li>Operating Room and Anesthesia costs</li>
</ol><p>The prices vary dramatically around the country but are usually comparative within a given region. Many patients have posted their costs on RealSelf.com. The total fee can typically run from $5000 to $10000 depending on area. (David Bogue, MD, Boca Raton Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The primary variable in the cost of breast augmentation surgery is geographical. In Louisville, most surgeons charge in the neighborhood of $5,000 for saline implants and a bit more for silicone. This represents the total charge and includes the surgeon’s fee, implants, facility, anesthesia charges, and supplies. (John Whitt, MD (retired), Louisville Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast augmentation surgery cost should not be first factor</h3><p>Although cost is a crucial part of making a decision to have breast augmentation surgery, it should not be the first. As you see from the answers already given the cost can vary dramatically. Beware of the lowest bidder or if someone says “I will beat any price”. You are not buying a TV. You are buying expertise, care and long term outcome. First choose a surgeon by their credentials – board certification, local respected hospital plastic surgery privileges, then by referrals – other doctors, patients, etc. Once you have narrowed down two well respected surgeons, then see if they match your personality and that you like their bedside manner.</p><p>Also make sure that the after surgery care is just as attentive as the preop. Speak with former patients if you need to. Once you have done all that homework usually one surgeon stands out and cost at that point does not matter. If for some reason you still can’t decide, then compare costs and make the best choice possible.</p><p>Some charge very low to get your business and some charge very high to appear better eventhough they are not – so fees are not a good place to start. They will not tell you anything about the surgeon or their outcome or their care. Word of mouth about their reputation is the best place to start. Fees are only one of many factors to consider.
