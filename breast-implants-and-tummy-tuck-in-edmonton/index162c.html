(Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast augmentation and tummy tuck (abdominoplasty) in Edmonton aka Mommy Makeover.</h3><p>This combination of procedures is commonly performed simultaneously and are also known as the “Mommy Makeover”. Occasionally this involves the use of a breast lift depending on the degree of sagging (ptosis).

</div><p>Abdominoplasty and Breast Augmentation surgery are often combined during the same operative session. The two surgeries complement each other and there are few reasons to avoid doing these surgeries at the same time.</p><p>Together, a tummy tuck and breast augmentation will improve the contour of the chest and torso. (Raffy Karamanoukian, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Combining Breast Augmentation and Tummy Tuck Surgeries</h3><p>Combining surgeries such as a tummy tuck and a breast augmentation can be a great option for many patients. Pregnancy can result in a number of changes to a woman’s body and this is most notably seen in both the abdomen and breasts.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1734" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>Skin is stretched, often beyond what the body’s natural elasticity can handle, and then results in a relative sagging of the skin, permanent relaxation of the support structure of the abdominal muscles as well as a loss of breast tissue after breast feeding. As a result, the combination of most breast and abdominal surgeries has been given it’s own name – the “mommy makeover.” The benefits of dual procedures is several fold. Firstly, these surgeries can only be combined if your physician has deemed it safe.</p><p>With respect to the surgeries, the recovery time for both procedures occurs simultaneously. This allows for less time off work or away from the care of your children etc. Easing the stress on your family and friends who will help you through the process. An additional benefit is that the cost of the surgery is often less than the two surgeries if done independently. Surgical/OR costs are less for each additional hour in surgery – just think that everything is already open, the staff is there, instruments can be used for both procedures without any problem.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1733" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-02fc81880a09569e5d051b409039c791">

</div><p>There are risks, although very small in a healthy patient, with general anesthesia. Thus, only having one anesthetic is better than two – unless there is a medical reason you should not have a longer procedure. Finally, there is a psychological benefit of having the procedures done. I commonly have patients who are anxious about their surgery, and it is nice to be able to have all of this done in one setting. In short, it is a great choice as long as your health permits it, and your doctor can determine this after performing a full exam in a formal consultation. (Vincent P. Marin, MD, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tummy tuck and breast augmentation in Edmonton is a great combination</h3><p>Breast implants and abdominoplasty (tummy tuck) are great procedures to do simultaneously if you are healthy. Dr. Thellman’s response sums this up beautifully. The aesthetic outcome of doing both are better than individually as enlarging the breasts helps make the tummy look smaller and having a tummy tuck makes the breasts look larger. The two combined give dramatic results. A complete discussion of risks and benefits is essential with your surgeon to determine if you are a good candidate. (Brian J. Lee, MD, Fort Wayne Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Combining these two operations often makes a lot of…</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1732" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-05d5972330a5ce9da40cb071f12d1b9e">

</div><p>Combining these two operations often makes a lot of sense. It’s one less trip to the operating room, one less recovery period, and may save you some money in operating room fees, anesthesia, etc. If you are healthy and considering doing both procedures it’s certainly something to talk about with your plastic surgeon. There are some potential drawbacks: The recovery from either of these procedures can be painful, especially for the first day or two, so combining them can be a big hit for some people. It’s a longer operation, and therefore don’t be surprised if your surgeon suggests an overnight stay for monitoring. If you have some potential risk factors for complications (diabetes or other medical conditions) your surgeon might advise you to stage the procedures to be safe. For most 45 year old patients, however, this is a very reasonable option and one we often do in our practice. My advice? Ask to talk to someone who’s had it done, through this message board or one of your surgeon’s previous patients. I think patients can give a unique prospective on the post-op recovery period and pain involved when combining these two. (Scott Thellman, M.D., Lawrence Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast implants and tummy tuck</h3><p>I perform breast implants all the time in conjunction with a tummy tuck.</p><p>In fact, sometimes I will do the breast augmentation through the tummy tuck incision for the right patient.</p><p>This will eliminate any scar on or near the breast. (Steven Wallach, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Augmentation and Tummy Tuck in Edmonton – Simple Mommy Makeover</h3><p>Combining a breast augmentation with an abdominoplasty operation is one of the simplest types of mommy makeover surgery.</p><p>If you have a thin physique, the surgical time is around 3 to 3.5hr, and if you require an extended abdominoplasty it might take 4 to 4.5hrs.</p><p>The amount of discomfort from a breast implants is significantly less than a tummy tuck, so if you combine them both at the same time you do not notice the breast surgery that much. Because you don’t have to pay duplicated start-up costs for room time and anesthesia, there is a cost savings associated with combined surgery. If you are in good health and desire both procedures, I would recommend the combination. (Michael A. Bogdan, MD, FACS, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Multiple procedures are safe</h3><p>Many women choose to have multiple procedures done at one time. Consult with a board certified plastic surgeon to discuss your options. if you have a healthy medical history and are a good candidate for both the tummy tuck and breast implants surgeries, then it is very safe for you to have both done at one time. This would allow you to have one recovery time rather than doing them seperately. These procedures you put together is well known as a mommy makeover, due to the results of your body changing after pregnancy. (Tom J. Pousti, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Mommy makeovers- discuss safety with your surgeon</h3><p>As others here have said, this combination of surgeries is commonly performed together. it is important, however, that you discuss with your surgeon the extent of the surgeries and the time he or she anticipates it will take. Personally, I routinely perform straight forward abdominoplasties at the same time as straight forward breast augmentation.</p><p>If, however, the abdominoplasty is complicated or involving large amounts of tissue, I may recommend staging the surgeries for safety. One of the major complications of abdominoplasty procedures has classically been blood clots that can form in the legs, and rarely can travel to the lungs and be fatal. most surgeons to everything possible to avoid this issue, including compression of your legs in surgery, and performing the abdominoplasty as the second part of the operation. Some surgeons, like myself, use blood thinners at the time of abdominoplasty surgery to prevent this complication. As blood thinners may increase the possibility of bleeding, operations on other parts of the body at the same time may be problematic in complicated cases. You should discuss these issues with your surgeon, and together make the right decision for you. (Adam David Lowenstein, MD, FACS, Santa Barbara Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>TABA TransAbdominoplasty Breast Augmentation</h3><p>It is very comon to combine breast implants with abdominoplasty. Some have coined this the mommy makeover surgery. If someone is just haveing breast implants with abdominoplasty you should really consider the TABA approach where the implants are placed through the abdominoplasty incision. This is a very good approach when performed by someone with experience in this technique. (William J. Hedden, MD, Birmingham Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Combined breast and tummy tuck surgery very common</h3><p>EXTREMELY common. To the point where they name them – MOMMY MAKEOVER procedures. In our practice we do them on a weekly basis. The Breasts can be lifted, lifted AND augmented, or less commonly Reduced/lifted. The Tummy is flattened, waist narrowed, loose tummy skin removed, droopy Mons pubis lifted. Potentially, this may also be combined with Liposuction of the back which will define the upper buttocks and the hips. (Peter A. Aldea, MD, Memphis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Breast implants and Tummy Tuck (a.k.a. Mommy Makeover) is a popular combination of procedures to perform together.</p><p>In some case I also add a breast lift and some liposuction to achieve the best results.</p><p>This is all assuming that you are a good candidate for surgery. (David Shafer, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Combining Breast implants and Tummy Tuck</h3><p>Combining breast implants (with or without a lift) and tummy tuck surgery is safe as long as both procedures can be performed within a reasonable amount of time.</p><p>The recommendation by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons is to limit anesthesia time to six hours or less. If you are healthy, at or within 10-15 pounds of your ideal weight, these two surgeries can usually be performed together. (Michael A. Jazayeri, MD, Santa Ana Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>What are the components of a Mommy Makeover?</h3><p>The term Mommy Makeover refers to a combination of procedures designed to return a woman’s body to the pre-pregnancy condition (or better!), by addressing the changes that pregnancy and childbirth bring to (most often) the breasts and abdomen.</p><p>Mommy makeover, therefore, can include breast lift, breast augmentation, or breast lift with augmentation, and a tummy tuck, modified tummy tuck, or mini-tummy tuck. Other possible combinations are possible, but I think you get the point.</p><p>The most common combination is breast augmentation with a tummy tuck in Edmonton, and as long as you are in good health and an otherwise good candidate for surgery and anesthesia, it does make a lot of sense to combine them. By doing so, you will experience one recovery period rather than two, meaning less time away from family and/or work responsibilities and your preferred activities.</p><p>You will usually also save a bit of money, as combining them shortens the overall length of surgery, and by improving the efficiency of your surgeon and the OR team, your costs are also reduced (in most practices). Find a surgeon certified by The American Board of Plastic Surgery and discuss your goals with them. (Armando Soto, MD, FACS, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Mommy makeover commonly includes breast implants </h3><p>Many women lose breast volume after pregnancy which is easily restored with breast implants. The abdomen often is problematic as well so combining breast augmentation with abdominoplasty in Edmonton is a common combination. (Vincent N. Zubowicz, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Mommy makeover – Breast and Belly</h3><p>Mommy makeover is combining breast surgery and belly surgery. We mommies are busy. We don’t have time for downtime. When you are healthy, it is frequently safe to do breast surgery with belly / body surgery. Babies hurt breasts and bellies the most. So mommies came in for combined breast and belly procedures, and this became the popular phrase “mommy makeover.” Breast implants is a short surgery with minimal blood loss. Tummy tuck is a larger surgery, but safe. In most cases, it is safe to do the two procedures together.</p><p>This is one of the most popular combinations I have for mommy makeover. Everything is relative; for my overweight patients, they may combine liposuction with a tummy tuck, in which case any breast surgery may be too much to do at the same time. If you have other health issues, are anemic, etc.</p><p>You may not be able to combine the surgery. You are a mommy. You need to be safe. Assuming you are a good candidate, then go for it. It is the only mommy vacation (i.e. healing after surgery) you may get for a while. (Lauren Greenberg, MD, Palo Alto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Mommy Makeover combination does not mean complication</h3><p>“Mommy Makeovers” typically involve reversing many of the changes that come from pregnancy.</p><p>In most cases, this means tightening the loose abdominal skin, restoring the muscles to their pre-pregnancy locations, and removing excess fat.</p><p>Often, a breast lift, with or without implants for added fullness, is combined with the tummy procedures. For patients in good health, these procedures may be combined. T</p><p>his approach offers patients one downtime, one time off work, and one exposure to anesthesia. The expense is almost always less with combined procedures, too.</p><p>As with any surgery, a careful medical history is always needed. Appropriately addressing any concerns such as smoking, possible heart issues, or diabetes will ensure the sucess and safety of the procedure. (John LoMonaco, MD, FACS, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Mommy Makeover a good combination of breast and abdomen</h3><p>In well selected patients (healthy, w/o anesthesia risks, etc.) we find that patients enjoy combining the procedures. This permits a single recovery period as well. Breast augmentation gives enhanced breast appearance. Tummy tuck includes various procedure elements: fat removal, skin tightening, and muscle tightening. Liposuction may also be suggested, but that may necessitate a separate surgery to treat additional areas. The most important factor in success with these procedures (and all cosmetic plastic surgery) is selecting an experienced, board-certified plastic surgeon. Do your research and meet with several until you are sure you’ve picked the best. (Sutton Graham II, MD, Greenville Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Combining Breast Augmentation with Abdominoplasty in Edmonton</h3><p>A lot of women choose to have this combination. Women lose breast volume after pregnancy in addition to typical effects on the abdomen.</p><p>So, it’s natural to want to augment their breasts. Occasionally, they also need a breast lift with the implants.</p><p>I believe that it is a safe option and doesn’t significantly increase the risks beyond those inherent with the individual procedures. Patient can save a second anesthesia, downtime, and cost. (Rafi S. Bidros, MD, FACS, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Combing breast implants and abdominoplasty in Edmonton</h3><p>Each patient is different. The operating time should be limited as already described. You must be a good candidate with no significant medical problems. Most importantly, it is your life and demands on you that are most important. For example, if you have subpectoral implants and abdominoplasty with tightening of the muscles, you are going to be recovering for a while. If you have implants on top of the muscle, your recovery will be a little easier.</p><p>You will not be able to lift much, etc. So it depends on who is dependent on you, what your daily activities normally are, etc. Do you have young children? Do you have help at home? Are you a care provider for a parent? How long can you take off from work? All these factors are important. Planning, so your life will not be completely disrupted, is the key. I find that after talking with patient, we can easily figure out the best plan for her and it varies from patient to patient.
