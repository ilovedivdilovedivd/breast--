Measurements of the breast are completed so the implants chosen will fit the patient’s size and frame.</p><p>Assistance to sizing can also be performed using the VECTRA breast analysis which is a 3D digital image of the breast using computer software to show patients the size and shape of different breast implant types.</p><p>It is the best way to visually experience what you will look like after surgery and help you decide on size. (David L. Robbins, MD, FACS, West Des Moines Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast implant sizing</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1799" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>There are different approaches to breast implant selection. Regardless of the approach used, I try to counsel patients on not getting to hung up on a number.</p><p>I think its important to but these numbers in perspective. A can of Coke is 355cc. A shot of tequila is 30cc. Often patients are getting stressed out by determining between two implant sizes that are 25cc apart, so I try to remind them that 25cc is not a large volume and that there is no wrong decision to be made. When they are really unsure, I usually advise them to go with the implant that is slightly larger. I have never had a patient come back feeling like they are two large and requesting a switch for an implant 25cc smaller. (Samir S. Rao, MD, Chevy Chase Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Determining the right size breast implant</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1798" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-c7b3e0b9854ed013c1592278f6f706f4">

</div><p>That being said, it is important to recognize that the difference between a 375 and a 400 cc implant is less than the volume of a shot glass (30cc). The volumetric difference is very small and would be difficult for a plastic surgeon to even appreciate. When the implants are placed under the muscle, I tell patients that they appear about 20 cc’s smaller than how they feel in the sizing bras. I wouldn’t spend too much time worrying about the minor discrepency.</p><p>Furhermore, you mentioned that you felt the 400 is too “top heavy”. Sometimes women are a bit apprehensive about a round upper pole of the breast and fear and overly augmented look. In this situation, some surgeons are using shaped implants which have a more gradual take off and a less “top heavy” look. Your plastic surgeon can discuss the pros and cons of a shaped implant with you in your decision making process. (Kunaal Jindal, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cup Size</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1800" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>It’s most important to select size based on what will look good on you and not based on preconceived ideas of bra sizes and cc’s. If you and your plastic surgeon can narrow it down to one or two sizes by having you try on sizers, then you have already won the battle. The difference between two adjacent sizes is ultimately much less than you think and certainly not even close to the difference between a C cup and a D cup. Or better put – If you try on sizers, and fall in love with the appearance of a particular implant, and it turns out not to be a “full C”, do you no longer like it? (Richard L. Zeff, MD, Portsmouth Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Implant size and final breast size</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1802" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Your selection of implants depends on the width of your chest and the final “look” you would like – more natural or more obviously “augmented”.After selecting the appropriate width implant, the projection and shape of the implant can vary to give you the final appearance you and your surgeon decide on for you. (Jason J. Hall, MD, FACS, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>As long as your surgeon is going off of our base diameter (as it sounds he/she is) then you should be happy with both. The difference between the two (25cc) is so small when you are looking in the 400cc range that one could be in one side and one in the other and you probably wouldn’t notice the difference.</p><p>This being said, the number one complaint among breast augmentation patients Is “I should have gone bigger”. (Christopher T. Maloney Jr., MD, Tucson Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cup sizes are not universal</h3><p>First, It is very difficult to talk in terms of cup sizes because they are not standardized. In most cases, one cup size is 150 to 200 cc’s of volume.</p><p>Unfortunately, that is a very rough estimate and it is less accurate on very small or very large people.</p><p>Second, when you are in the 350 to 400 cc implant range, a 25 cc difference is probably imperseptable.</p><p>In our office we use the Vectra imaging system that helps tremendously with sizing. The Vectra takes a 3D picture of you and then through computer animation places implants into your form.</p><p>This allows our patients to compare sizes and shapes of implants on their own body. If you have an opportunity to visit a practice that utilizes the Vectra, the 3D simulation will alleviate your anxiety and fears. (Stephan Finical, MD, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Selecting an implant size</h3><p>Selecting the correct implant for you his a combination of both art and science. Measurements of your chest wall dimensions and your current cup size will give your surgeon a starting point. After that, the selection of the implant depends mostly on the type of look you wish to achieve.</p><p>In general, the higher the profile of the implant, the more “augmented” the look. Volume changes of 25 to 50 mL are rarely enough to change your postoperative cup size. The more important determinant is the shape of the implant. (Earl E. Ferguson III, MD, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast implant size</h3><p>A very big part of the discussion prior to surgery is “what size”. We discuss with the patient her goals and try on sizers to pick a size. All patients are built differently but pictures, sizers and a full discussion helps. Generally 400cc will accomplish your goals to achieve a C cup. (Frank J. Ferraro, MD, Paramus Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Full C-cup</h3><p>I believe 350cc implants would likely make you a full C-cup. 400cc would push most patients your size into the D-cup range. (David Stoker, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>375cc or 400cc implants for breast augmentation?</h3><p>In general, implant size does not correlate with bra cup size. The cup size itself will vary from manufacturer to manufacturer as well as who is doing the actual measurements. Thus, cup size is never a reliable indicator for your breast size. I typically encourage my patients not to communicate her desires in cup size but more on the actual look and appearance.</p><p>Given your desires, a breast augmentation, with an implant or fat grafting, would be an ideal procedure that would meet your expectations. Breast augmentation is now the most popular procedure performed in plastic surgery today. One tolerated very well by women with minimal downtime and high patient satisfaction.</p><p>Good communication between you and your surgeon of your expectations is warranted – choosing your surgeon wisely is the first step. Discussion of your wishes and having an honest and open dialog of your procedure is mandatory (e.g, implant type, incision, placement, etc).</p><p>Your height, weight, breast width, and body habitus will make a difference for which implant style/projection to choose. Implant profile will also make a difference on the projection, which will influence overall breast/cup size. I have found that photographs brought by the patient is helpful to get a visualization of the appearance you wish for in terms of size, shape, fullness, etc.</p><p>In addition, your surgeon’s pre and postoperative photographs should demonstrate a realistic goal for you of results. Sizers are helpful during an in-office consultation. Once this has been accomplished, allow your surgeon to utilize his/her best medical judgment during the procedure to finesse the best possible result for you after preoperative biodimensional planning and fitting the right implant for your breast width. This is the most important determinant for the sizing of implants, which will provide the optimal result and most aesthetically-pleasing result for you. Consult with a board-certified plastic surgeon well-versed in breast procedures who will examine and discuss with you the various options and factors to consider and help you decide which one will be the right one for you.  (Lewis Albert Andres, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The most useful way to use the sizers is to identify the size you find to be too large, then drop down just a little. The implants will look smaller after surgery than the sizers.</p><p>Based on your experience with the sizers, 380 cc in a high profile implant will give you that in-between size you want, the projection you are looking for, yet not look too overdone. (Gary Lawton, MD, FACS, Dayton Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Correct Size of Breast Implants</h3><p>The difference between a 375 to 400 cc implant is less than one ounce. This amount of volume will not make a significant change in your appearance. More importantly is the overall size and shape of your implants and how they correspond to your unique anatomical features.</p><p>Someone with a narrow chest may look more natural with high projection implants which have a narrow base versus someone with a wide chest who may benefit from moderate projection implants with a wide base.</p><p>It sounds as if you have discussed your desires with your plastic surgeon and he will take them into consideration when he is performing your breast augmentation. Any of the implants you mentioned will provide a great enhancement to your contour! (Andrew Goldberg, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>You should try on several implants to decide size</h3><p>Without seeing you in person, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to recommend which size implant will look most natural. First of all, I’d like to emphasize that a 375cc and 400cc only differ by 25cc, which is a very small amount.</p><p>Your doctor will decide which projection is best based on your chest diameter in order to give you the most natural result. I recommend that you try on all possible sizes to see which feels most natural on your body, and then you can discuss with your surgeon which projection will fit your chest in the best way. (David Rapaport, MD, Fort Myers Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>375cc vs 400cc breast implant size</h3><p>There is very little difference between the two implant sizes you are considering. Your board certified plastic surgeon is best able to recommend the size that will best for you.</p><p>I tell my patients that they will not know there bra size for 8 – 12 weeks after the surgery when they get measured at their favorite store. Remember the implant volume does not translate to a specific bra or cup size because the final size in the combination of the implant volume and the amount of breast tissue present.</p><p>The same size implant can give different bra sizes in deferent women because of that. (Ralph R. Garramone, MD, Manchester Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Implant size</h3><p>Implant sizing is not strightforward. It depends on your chest shape and width as well as what tissue you have and the amount of skin laxity. A difference of 25cc on an implant of this size is going to make very little difference. The largest you can have is determined by the width of your chest and then you can usually go for a little extra projection if you have an anatomical (teardrop) shaped implant. Take the advice of your PS best wishes (Gerard Lambe, MD, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Moderate plus or high profile</h3><p>Your a an excellent candidate for either implant. I agree go with 400cc. If you are considering a partial, sub muscular augmentation. The Mod plus or high profile base width is more appropriate. Your plastic surgeon will review the final selection with you. (William C. Rigano, MD, )</p><p>I use moderate plus implant for the vast majority of my breast augmentations.</p><p>I find that this is good projection towards the apex of the breast and yet does not create excessive upper pole fullness.</p><p>With respect to your question, I find that difference is a 25 cc are hardly noticeable once placed behind the breast tissue.</p><p>I think he you will find that many surgeons have many opinions about which types of implants to use and in fact I think, it’s really a matter of personal preference.</p><p>I would not perseverate over a difference of 25 cc, though with your description I think I think that a 375 cc moderate plus type of implant would give you good shape you’re looking for.</p><p>Make sure you have the appropriate size and shape sizers and where some of your normal clothing over these sizers once placed in the appropriate brassiere.</p><p>Remember that the final outcome will likely be a little smaller than it appears when implants are placed over the chest wall and in a brassiere. (Adam David Lowenstein, MD, FACS, Santa Barbara Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Predicting cup size and fullness</h3><p>Cup size is a very badly defined measure of breast size. Bra manufacturers have not developed a standard measure of cup sizes, and most patients, (according to some studies, OVER 75%) wear the wrong bra. Bra cup size, according bra fitters, is measured by the curve of the edge of your breast, regardless of the volume of your breast ( i.e. how much breast).</p><p>So you can be a C cup , but not fill it out, and wear an A cup to push your breasts into a rounded, full shape.Predicting what bra cup size you are going to be after an augmentation is very very difficult. I usually come to an agreement with the patient as to what volume she wants to be.</p><p>It sounds like you are going to be happy with about 375cc, and the “profile” , which I again thinks a bad term, is decided upon based on her breast dimensions. If you are quite narrow chested, to get that 375cc into the space available, you may need a moderate plus, or even a high profile, which is better thought of as a narrower width, and a very narrow (and therefore projecting more) implant.</p><p>There, is that clear? or more confusing. Go over this with your doctor again. It’s a lot to grasp and you are undergoing surgery, so understandably cautious; there are so many opinions and choices out there. (Benjamin Gelfant, MD, Vancouver Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast implant sizing</h3><p>Breast implant sizing should, in my opinion, be a thoughtful and logical process during a formal consultation. Patients should come to the consultation prepared to discuss theri aeshtetic goals – bust fullness, breast shape and figure balance. Brining photos to wxamples you like an ddo not like is helpful. After the pyscilal examination, the surgeon will be able to recommend implants that will satisfy the patients aeshtetic goals. Many surgeons use implant sizing, 2D photography, 3D photography and /or gallery examples to help in this process. At the end of the day 25c is a very minimal difference and I would suggest you use the implant that best fits your anatomy. (Michael B. Tantillo, MD, Boston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>If it’s “natural” breasts you want – the moderate profile is for you</h3><p>Natural breasts have a nice upper pole but no bulging above a straight line from clavicle to nipple. This is the look of a moderate profile implant. Moderate plus implants look slightly fuller than natural in the upper pole.</p><p>Make sure you know the look you want then determine the corresponding profile. Examples are available on my web site. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>375cc or 400cc Implants for Breast Augmentation?</h3><p>The size of a breast implant really depends on the dimension of each individual’s chest width – a 400cc implant on a small frame will look much larger than on someone who has a larger frame. It is more important to determine an implant that has the same width as the breast mound; otherwise the shape of the breast may look distorted.</p><p>Also, there are different projections and shapes of the breast implants. With that being said, the difference between 375cc or 400cc is very minimal and the physical appearance is typically not appreciable physically. Generally, after surgery and healing, more patients tend to say they would rather be a little bigger than smaller after all is said and done.Your plastic surgeon will be able to better guide this decision making after examining you physically and understanding your goals.
