(Robert Brueck, MD, Fort Myers Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Choose your surgeon- your body is not a blue light special</h3><p>The most important factor in your overall result is your surgeon. Some mistakes are very hard to fix – your best chance at a beautiful result is the first procedure. Make sure you go to a surgeon certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery!Price varies according to implant choice, region, and surgeon experience. Visit a few surgeons in your area to get an idea of what the procedure will cost you and then choose based upon your experience with that surgeon and his or her staff. In the short run saving a few bucks may cost you thousands if you are unhappy and require revisionary surgery. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The stem cell cost of breast augmentation varies by surgeon, region of the country, and difficulty of each procedure. The average cost for a stem cell breast augmentation in the United States is about $5,000 to $10,000.</p><p>In Florida where I practice, the average price for stem cell breast augmentation is about $5,500 to $8,000.</p><p>This price includes the surgeon’s fee, anesthesia fee, and the facility fee; prices advertised for less may not include these necessary charges.</p><p>The price may be less for saline implants and more for silicone breast implants. Additional charges will apply depending on the complexity of the operation and other necessary procedures such as a breast lift or removal of previous implants.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1579" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-c7b3e0b9854ed013c1592278f6f706f4">

</div><p>I would caution you against picking a plastic surgeon based only on price. It is more important to ensure that your plastic surgeon is certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery, experienced, comes well recommended, and is able to show you a wide range of before and after breast augmentation photos. (Jaime Perez, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Stem cell breast augmentation cost is quite variable across Canada and even within a large city like Montreal. Stem cell breast augmentation can cost from $5000.00 – $10,000.00, including all fees and taxes, depending on the choice of saline vs. silicone gel, hospital setting vs. private clinic and of course the experience of the surgeon.</p><p>Some clinics, including ours, offer financing plans. While price is important, “bargain-hunting” when it comes to your face or body is not a good idea. A poorly done breast augmentation can result in one or more revision surgeries, usually at your expense, not to mention needless stress and health risks. Choose your surgeon carefully and base your decision on qualifications, experience and results. (Arie Benchetrit, MD, Montreal Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1577" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>Breast augmentation surgery depends on whether the implant is saline or silicone. Silicone cost about 1000 dollars more. The cost tends to be more in large cities. A good range for a top notch job is 6000 to 8500 dollars. (Miguel Delgado, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Stem cell breast augmentation cost depends on many factors</h3><p>Stem cell breast augmentation cost on many factors, such as saline vs gel-does the surgeon operate in a hospital or out-patient facility or in his/her own facility. Also, cost depends on geography as well in many cases – There are also surgery centers operating as mills-where they just do volume after volume-so beware of that-in the end you get what you pay for-get a good average rate from within your area and see whether you see a great variety among prices and then find out why. (Edward J. Bednar, MD, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Surgical fees for breast enhancement</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1578" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Surgeons’ fees vary depending on the location in the nation. There are several great resources on line such as the American board of plastic surgery and the American society of plastic surgery which will give patients an average range of fees for different types of plastic surgery.</p><p>Remember to check to make sure your surgeon is certified by the American board of plastic surgery and that they specialize in breast enhancement and have the experience. Look at many of the before and after pictures on line and see if these appear to be samples of what you are looking for yourself. (Kimberly a. Henry, md, Greenbrae plastic surgeon)</p><p>Natural breast augmentation cost varies from doctor to doctor and from one geographic area to another.</p><p>Start with a board certified plastic surgeon, then evaluate his results. Don’t choose your surgeon based on cost, because for you, your result will be priceless. (Daniel J. Casper, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Natural breast augmentation cost</h3><p>Natural breast augmentation costs vary from surgeon to surgeon and vary based on locale. Research costs in your area by phone or on the internet but most important factors include the reputation, expertise, experience and certification of the surgeon.</p><p>Be sure the procedure is performed in an accredited facility and there is a certified anesthesia provider at the time of surgery. Usually silicone cost $1000 more but is worth it most of the time. (Terrence Murphy, MD, Englewood Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost of a Natural Breast Augmentation consists of 3 components:</p><ul>
<li>The surgeons fees</li>
<li>The implant fees</li>
<li>The facility and anesthesia fees</li>
</ul><p>The range is about $4500-$5500. Most of our Natural Breast Augmentation surgeries are done on an outpatient basis at the surgery center. I like to put the implants in through the armpit so that it leaves no scar on the breast. (Bernard Shuster, MD, Hollywood Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cost of attractive breasts</h3><p>“Price is what you pay, value is what you get.” After successfully performing thousands of natural breast augmentation surgeries in Las Vegas, our patients appreciate the fact that experience matters.</p><p>They have even told some of my office staff that we do not charge enough. I am just pleased to have more happy patients. Base your decision on value, not price. (George John Alexander, MD, FACS, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How much should a natural breast augmentation cost?</h3><p>Natural breast augmentation cost varies by geographic region as the costs of running a medical practice vary greatly by geography. Also, costs vary as to whether your surgeon uses a nurse anesthetist or a physician anesthesiologist (if they don’t use either, don’t even consider it). Silicone gel implants cost a little more than saline. Here is something most patients do not consider:</p><p>What is the cost, in terms of surgical, anesthesia and facilities fees, lost income and downtime if you have to have a surgical revision of your first procedure. The national averages in the silicone gel premarket studies show a reoperation rate of 15 (3 yrs) to 40% (7 years). Add that into the cost of the surgery! Using Dr. Tebbetts methods, we have been able to achieve a 3 yr reoperation rate of only 1.5% for silicone gel implants. (Mark D. Epstein, MD, Stony Brook Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Implants: Check TOTAL cost vs. Surgeon’s fee only.</h3><p>In Minneapolis, our surgical fee is $2245. Implant costs are $1750 for silicone ($1150 for saline). Operating room costs are $1165, and anesthesia charges are $790. This TOTALS $5950 for silicone augmentation, including free consultation, unlimited follow-up visits, and in the rare event of post-operative bleeding, no-charge reoperation.</p><p>At present we offer a discount for cash, making the cost $5772. In our two-surgeon practice, we do several hundred breast surgeries each year – it is our most common operation in our on-site AAAASF-accredited outpatient office surgical facility.</p><p>Please take the time to read Dr. Peter A. Aldea’s answer as well; he has included CRITICALLY IMPORTANT information that all reputable board-certified plastic surgeons enthusiastically agree with. Remember that the sweetness of low price is quickly forgotten with the bitterness of poor quality! (Richard H. Tholen, MD, FACS, Minneapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Beware of low cost breast augmentations</h3><p>While it is attractive to “shop” for the cheapest natural breast augmentation, it is important to realize that no 2 surgeons results will be the same, even on the same patient. It is also much more expensive to have to revise a poor result than to get it right the first time. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Realself has excellent resources for this. but depending on several factors natural breast augmentation will vary from 3500 up to 12,000. (Otto Joseph Placik, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Remember that fees vary widely by location. You have to beware of cutting costs and compromising safety. The total cost includes surgical fee, buying the implants, the operating room expenses, and the anesthesia cost. Particularly in the last two, there is a risk of cutting corners.</p><p>In our practice in Manhattan, we refer patients who cannot afford these fees to a plastic surgery teaching clinic, where the surgery is done by residents in training under supervision. This is a safe option, and much less expensive. (George J. Beraka, MD (retired), Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast augmentation prices vary</h3><p>I encourage you to not make your decision on who will perform your breast surgery based upon costs.</p><p>It is just like fillers and botox, if you find somewhere that is less expensive you typically don’t have a plastic surgeon or their nurse taking care of you. The old saying of you get what you pay for is very true. Having rambled on like that, it will vary between different geographic locations. Look for board certified plastic surgeons in your area and inquire with them what their approximate costs are. (Michael C. Edwards, MD, FACS, Santa Rosa Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Beware of the lowest breast augmentation cost</h3><p>Make sure you have a board-certified plastic surgeon. That is more important than any other decision, including cost. You can get surgery very cheaply and you usuallly get what you pay for. We have heard of surgery even in this country , where the surgeon just learned the procedure in a course and they are trying to get their first few patients for less than it costs the surgeon to buy the implants, run the OR and hire his staff. Protect yourself. Look for a surgeon Certified by The American Board of Plastic Surgery. (Francisco Canales, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast augmentation cost varies greatly depending on several factors</h3><p>One of the biggest factors affecting the cost of surgery is geographic location. When looking at cost in areas like Manhattan this is not always a good means of camparison. this is one of the most expensive cities in the world, and everything costs more there. In a smaller city or suburban area the cost may be quite diffierent. If you are trying to get a good idea of the reasonable cost for an augment I would suggest that you call some of the board certified plastic surgeons in your area to get a range. When you do this make sure the cost includes everything needed to do the surgery.</p><p>In other words, make sure there are no costs that are hidden or not discussed. In general, the cost should cover the surgeon’s fee, the implant costs, anesthesia fee’s (ask who will administer the anesthesia-this can affect the cost), and the facility fee. Also ask whether the fee covers pre-and post-op visits. Also ask how the cost of complications will be addressed. Finally, if revisions of the surgery are needed how will this be charged. When inquiring about cost in your area make sure you are comparing apples to apples, and make sure of all the things that your are getting for that cost. (Phillip H. Nakano, MD, )</p><h3>Breast augmentation may cost $10,000</h3><p>There is no standard price. All costs included – doctors fee, anesthesia fee, OR fee, and cost of implants make this about $10,000. Also it depends if you are having saline or silicone implants as there is a difference in their costs. There are people who will give you low-ball estimates – but make sure you find out about all of the different parts of the surgery. This also varies by location within the US and how much experience your doctor has in doing this. (William B. Rosenblatt, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In the U.S the plastic surgery breast augmentation cost AVERAGES about $3600 for saline implants.</p><p>This is the fee for the surgery and post op. care. This does NOT include facility and anesthesia fees.</p><p>Finally there are significnt variations in different parts of the country and for levels of experience of the board certified Plastic Surgeon. (Barry H. Dolich, MD, Bronx Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cost of plastic surgery breast augmentation</h3><p>Depending on where you live, the surgeon you go to, and the type of implant you want (silicone is usually more expensive than saline), the price will vary.</p><p>You should count on a surgeon’s fee, and implant fee (this may be included in the surgeon’s fee), an OR fee, and an anesthesia fee. Together, this could cost between $5000 to $9000 or more. In the end, I would recommend a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon who can offer you the best chance at an excellent result, with the least risk and the speediest recovery. (Shahram Salemy, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Plastic surgery breast augmentation cost is variable</h3><p>The cost of any surgery is too variable, and depends mostly on where you live. The costs will generally be higher in major metropolitan areas such as New York and throughout California. In less populated areas such as where I practice in Utah, you’ll often find prices thousands of dollars less. Ask your friends for recommendations and go wherever you feel most comfortable. (Brian K. Brzowski, MD, Ogden Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Plastic surgery breast augmentation pricing</h3><p>For accurate pricing of plastic surgery breast augmentation there are different types of implants to consider and also how much asymmetry a patient may have. To determine which implants and operation would fit best for you, visit a board certified plastic surgeon and get a consultation. (Peter Kreymerman, MD, FACS, Morehead City Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
