I want them to start slowly and they feel pain then stop for a few days. (Frank J. Ferraro, MD, Paramus Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Advise for exercise after breast augmentation</h3><p>Exercise after breast surgery is advisable, but you should begin with low impact relaxed exercise and build up gradually over 6 weeks to return to normal exercise routine. During the first 2 weeks after augmentation, you are at an increased risk of bleeding with vigorous exercise.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1632" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I advise walking, as much as tolerated, in the first two weeks. I advise patients to return to light exercise (low resistance ellipse, etc.) in weeks 2-4, then moderate exercise including light weight training in weeks 4-6, and then unrestricted after 6 weeks. (John Zavell, MD, FACS, Toledo Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Exercise after breast augmentation surgery</h3><p>I think its okay to do light body weight exercise – treadmill, stair climbing, walking – shortly after breast augmentation surgery. Weight bearing exercise, barbell work, gymnastics, Crossfit, Zumba should be curtailed for 6 weeks to give the pectoral muscles a rest. (Scott C. Sattler, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Exercise and Breast Augmentations</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1631" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-c7b3e0b9854ed013c1592278f6f706f4">

</div><p>My philosophy is wait 6wks. I know lots of doctors tell their patients that they can resume activity in a 1-2wks but I think that is too soon. There is lots of swelling and healing occuring and when one exercises the blood pressure rises and the breast augmentation swelling will worsen. Additionally the muscle is healing and you can tear it and cause internal bleeding and get either a hematoma or capsular contracture. (Rady Rahban, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Give it at least ten days.</h3><p>I ask patients to refrain from any strenuous exercise for ten days. That is, don’t do anything that raises your blood pressure or gets you to the point of perspiration. Walking is fine. You can walk miles and not raise your blood pressure. I usually see patients back at the ten day post operative time, and if everything looks good, I allow patients back to exercise. The benefit of taking it easy for the first ten days is that it allows your body to heal without interruption. The scar that your body forms around the implants we want to heal smoothly and softly. (Stephan Finical, MD, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Best Advice for Exercise</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1633" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-326e6279312e456c66f14329a9eb3680">

</div><p>It is always best if you do not elevate your blood pressure or heart rate above your resting rate for 3-4 weeks after surgery. No lifting over 20 pounds or strenuous activity for 4 weeks. (David L. Robbins, MD, FACS, West Des Moines Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Take one week off</h3><p>I commend you for staying healthy and fit. Take one week off completely – only light walking. You don’t want to risk getting a hematoma (blood clot). The second week you can do the bike and lower body exercises.</p><p>After three weeks you can do anything except running, impact sports, and upper chest weight lifting. By 4-6 weeks you can resume any activity you like. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Exercise Following Breast Augmentation Surgery</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1634" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I realize how important an exercise routine can be to both physical and mental well being. After any surgery, it is absolutely essential to avoid excessive activity in order to be able to heal successfully. If you do too much too soon you can cause excess swelling and bleeding that may result in capsule formation that could permanently damage your results. You can also cause the implants to shift and assume an abnormal position that may require another surgery to correct. This does not mean that you have to just sit on the cough for three weeks, however. You can walk after the first couple of days and do a slow treadmill after the first week or so. The issue is to avoid getting your heart rate and blood pressure up as that would result in the swelling and bleeding. Using your legs gently would be okay but strenuous use of any muscle can cause problems too. I know that three weeks of limitations seem like forever, but you have to look at the big picture and realize that it is just part of the commitment you have to make to have your surgery turn out beautifully. (Marie E. Montag, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>After breast augmentation it’s important increase your activities slowly. This will help you have the best result.</p><p>For the first two weeks after surgery I recommend that patients only do light activities, like walking.</p><p>It’s important to avoid activities that raise your heart rate or blood pressure during this time.</p><p>After two weeks you can resume lower body workouts, but should avoid any workouts that target the chest.</p><p>It takes six weeks until patients can do any activity without restriction. (Austin Hayes, MD, Portland Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Most people who consider plastic surgery are doing something already to improve their body.</p><p>The time off from exercise is a concern to many. However important to your routine, it is not acceptable to change the postoperative recovery regimen to fit your personal goals. Wound healing is wound healing. Just because an individual wants it to move faster, it won’t. After breast augmentation, it is best to take a full week off from work and stay home. After that, it is safest to refrain from any vigorous physical activity for a month from surgery.</p><p>At that time, low-impact cardio is a good way to start. If one engages in exercise before the wounds are allowed to heal, there could be bleeding which ultimately can have a negative effect on the outcome. It is just not worth it to change what the surgeon has been doing to take care of thousands of patients just because you want to get back to the gym. This is surgery after all. You should be relying on your board certified plastic surgeon to provide you with the postoperative care that they have been trained for the better part of a decade to provide. (Gary Lawton, MD, FACS, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Advice for Exercise After Breast Augmentation?</h3><p>My advice to patients after their breast augmentation is to not resume full activities for 6 weeks after surgery. This is particularly important for implants placed below the muscle as forceful contraction prior to complete healing may displace the implant. Immediately after surgery patients are encourage to gently mobilise. This is aimed at keeping the blood flowing through the lower legs and reduce the chances of deep vein thrombosis. Breathing exercises are important to expand the lungs and prevent secondary chest complications after surgery. By the 2nd week patients should be going for walks around the block and engaging in low intensity cardiovascular exercises. Between 2-6 weeks patients can slowly increase their cardiovascular regimes but avoid upper limb and weight bearing exercises that may impact on the positioning of the implants. Always seek specific advice from your surgeon and remember that a short term sacrifice to ensure ideal healing can prevent long term complications. (Guy Watts, MBBS (Hons), FRACS (Plast), Perth Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Exercising after Breast Surgery</h3><p>In short a complication will lead to much longer time off the gym and leave you very unhappy therefore you should listen to your surgeon and rest in order to make a complication free recovery. This could save you months of trouble. In 2 weeks wounds are healed and light activity can resume. (Gerard Lambe, MD, Manchester Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Exercising after breast augmentation</h3><p>I totally understand the need to exercise, it is a hard habit to put on hold! However, you need to listen to your PS about these restrictions. If you are having the implants placed under the muscle you could significantly damage your results by working out too soon. Most patients don’t feel like working out for at least 2 weeks after the procedure.</p><p>After that time you need to restrict yourself to exercising after breast augmentation that don’t require pectorals activity. Stationary bike is a good solution to this problem, as long as you stay seated. Its always worth the wait too avoid complications. Best of luck! (Bradley A. Hubbard, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Each surgeon has his or her guidelines for postoperative care. Generally, you can begin light activity 5 to 7 days post surgery.</p><p>More strenuous activity can begin as soon as 3 weeks depending on how you are healing. Consult with your surgeon and follow his or her instruction as he or she knows the scope of the surgery and the specifics about you. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, Newark Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Exercise after breast augmentation</h3><p>Light activity should be OK after 2 weeks from procedure. Between 6-8 weeks after BA you should be ready to resume your previous activity. (Humberto Palladino, MD, FACS, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Working out after breast augmentation</h3><p>I understand that three weeks out of your workout routine can be an eternity for the physically fit. That said, there is a delicate balance between keeping yourself in shape and allowing yourself to recover from an invasive operation.</p><p>Having a complication after surgery is likely to set you back a lot further than taking off a few weeks from your workouts would. </p><p>I cannot stress enough the importance of having an open and honest conversation with your surgeon to outline the exact dos and don’ts after surgery and then sticking to that.</p><p>I allow my patients to go back to walking the week after surgery and some exercise classes after two weeks. (Meghan Nadeau, MD, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Maintaining an active lifestyle during post-op period?</h3><p>Unfortunately, there is no way around it – after surgery your body absolutely must have time to heal and recover! This is for two very good reasons: 1st and foremost – to avoid complications, and 2nd – to ensure your time and investment leads to the best possible result!</p><p>I would discuss your concerns with your plastic surgeon and see if he or she can come up with an individualized program to allow earlier, careful activity; however, bear in mind that he or she likely has a post-operative protocol in place for good reason. You’ve invested so much – it is worth the wait! (Bryan Correa, MD, The Woodlands Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Please follow only your surgeon’s answer to this question</h3><p>You and your physician should be working towards getting you the optimal result and making sure that you avoid any potential pitfalls or complications. As you can see, you will receive a variety of answers to this (relatively simple) question. Each surgeon bases their recommendations on their technique and their experience in assisting patients in the recovery process.</p><p>I usually have my patients wait 2 weeks before using a recumbent bike (to minimize any elevations in heart rate & blood pressure), allow them to return to more strenuous lower body exercises after week 4, and encourage upper body exercise only after the 4-6 week mark. Unfortunately, taking a survey of physicians here doesn’t change how your surgery was performed and how your surgeon expects the breast augmentation recovery to progress. (Erik Hoy, MD)</p><h3>Exercise After Breast Augmentation?</h3><p>I am a proponent of getting one back into training as soon as possible as long as it is safe and does not interfere with your results. In general it is not wise to be exercising the first few days after surgery – it is best to allow things to settle a bit, avoid the risk of bleeding and all.</p><p>Walking is encouraged during the first few days to reduce the risk of leg blood clots if one had general anesthesia. Although I have my patients avoid chest exercises for 5-6 weeks which allows the chest muscles to heal, I do allow other exercises that do not involve the chest.</p><p>Usually I allow running after a week and a half (wearing a sport bra) and allow isolated biceps and triceps exercises with the elbows at the sides to isolate these muscle groups. (George Volpe, MD, Boston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Working Out after Breast Augmentation</h3><p>It is extremely important for patients to not resume any physical activity for at least 4-6 weeks post surgery after a Breast Augmentation.</p><p>During the first 6 weeks of your surgery the implant needs to drop into the pocket and settle correctly.</p><p>If a patient resumes any physical activity before this time frame it can lead to serious complications such as a hematoma which will lead to another surgery.</p><p>After 1 to 2 weeks, patients can resume non-impact lower body exercises. (Leonard Hochstein, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Easing back into exercise is best</h3><p>Women who already enjoy being very physically active often feel frustrated after breast augmentation due to the limitations on physical exercises. </p><p>However, it’s important to understand that waiting a few weeks until resuming your normal workout routine doesn’t mean you’re confined to bed rest during that time either.</p><p>Mild to moderate physical activity should be fine by about 2 weeks after surgery, although you should continue avoiding exercises that focus on the chest muscles or doing heavy lifting for a bit longer.</p><p>Be sure to talk to your plastic surgeon to see what he or she recommends before you resume going to the gym. (Nirav Savalia, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Advice for Exercises after breast augmentation?</h3><p>As many patients are more into fitness these days, this question is very important. I have many patients that are into fitness training and they would like to return to the gym as soon as possible. After 2 weeks, most patients may resume a stationary bike and go on long walks. After 4 weeks, patients can resume light workouts, such as elliptical or running. At 6-8 weeks, patients may return to lifting and full workouts, although I would start with light weights.</p><p>These recommendations are for those with implants placed under the muscle as the pectoralis will need time to heal and settle – you do not want to over-activate this muscle during the healing phase. If you have implants placed above the chest muscle, you may resume these activities earlier. My recommendation is to play it conservatively since exercise is often considered mild trauma to the muscles.</p><p>Listen to your body, if it is not feeling up to it or you have mild aches with certain activities, it is better to wait and let the body heal and recover before creating more inflammation. (Gary Motykie, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Exercise after breast augmentation, connecticut</h3><p>I recommend no exercise that involves the chest muscles or bouncing exercises for 4 weeks. After your surgery (about 2 weeks) you can workout with no impact stationary biking, and walking on a treadmill.</p><p>This would be beneficial so long as you are on the right path with regards to healing. NO bouncing exercises. This recommendation comes with a strong warning to keep it to short durations, *15 min. at a time*, and increase protein and fluids. *Remember you are healing and your body need rest, so don’t over do it!</p><p>Healing properly is more important then getting to the gym a few weeks earlier and in the long run won’t make much of a difference as far as your fitness. (Alfred Sofer, MD, FACS, Fairfield Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Every surgeon is different, so you should follow your surgeon’s protocol. I generally advise my patients that they are able to walk and return to daily activities within several days of surgery. Moderate activities such as elliptical trainer are acceptable at about two weeks, and full return to unrestricted activities is acceptable at about four weeks. It is more important to ensure full and robust healing than to potentially threaten your full recovery after breast augmentation. Discuss your surgeon’s protocol with her or him. Best of luck.
