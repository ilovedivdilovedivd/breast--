</div><p>Recovering is affected by the technique performed: submammary is less painful than submuscualr because stretching & cutting the muscle is necessary when placing the implant in the submuscular position. Your pain tolerance will affect your recovering.</p><p>If you have ever had surgery in the past, the type of surgery and your response to that surgery can be discussed with your doctor to understand how you may respond to the placement of the implants. In general, most patients use a narcotic from 1-7 days after surgery.</p><p>About 25% will use just Advil/ Ibuprophen 800 mg every 6 hours for pain without any narcotic pain medication. This typically will control incision pain well.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_621" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-6f8aea5cdbde67a63ea22f9daf78966e">

</div><p>The implants will cause noticeable weight and possible shoulder and back discomfort for the 1st few weeks. Motion of the arms and trunk will typically cause aching more than pain due to the fact that the implant will be on top of, or under the muscle of the chest wall which attaches to the arms.</p><p>Rarely, patient’s will experience nausea or grogginess from the surgery. The surgery is not very long and if done with a well trained Anesthesiologist or Nurse Anesthetist, the patient should wake comfortable and pain controlled with no nausea. Definitely be sure that the Anesthetic provider is very good.

</div><p>Breast uplift surgery is an outpatient (go home the same day) surgery which is very well tolerated. The recovering period is slightly different depending on whether the implants are above or below the muscle. When placed above the muscle, the recovering is usually quicker. Pain medication and muscle relaxants may help with the discomfort. Although every patient is different, In general the recovering is similar to the following:</p><ul>
<li>Home the same day of surgery</li>
<li>Discomfort lasts from 24 hours to a week depending on implant placement</li>
<li>No heavy lifting or strenuous activity for two weeks</li>
<li>You may experience some nipple sensitivity for the first few weeks</li>
<li>Any bruising typically resolves in the first 2 weeks</li>

</div><p>The scars are pink and firm at 6 weeks but continue to improve in color and contour for 6-12 months. It is important to know these scars will always be there.</p><p>Massaging of the implants can be done as early as 2 weeks, but almost always started by 4 weeks Back to work in a week, depending on your job responsibilities Swelling can take 6 months or more to fully subside (David Bogue, MD, Boca Raton Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Average recovering time from breast augmentation</h3><p>Most women are able to return to desk-related activities within 4-6 days, although things such as exercising and other strenuous activities should not be attempted for a minimum of 3 weeks, on average. (Michael L. Workman, MD, Portland Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast uplift recovering</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_622" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Most patients recover very quickly and uneventfully after breast augmentation. Women who have had breast enlargement describe the recovery as tightness and pressure on the chest. This typically last 3 to 4 days. Most women say they feel fine a week after surgery and are back to normal two weeks post-op. I ask my patients to refrain from athletic or strenuous activities for three weeks after their surgery. Everyone is different, but most patients are surprised at how quickly they recover. Everyone has some swelling after the surgery which resolves in about 4-6 weeks. The implants may also be high initially, they tend to settle lower on the chest in 3-4 weeks. The incision starts out as a pink line which gradually fades into a fine white line. This may take up to a year depending upon your skin type. (James H. Schmidt, MD, Sarasota Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_624" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h3>Recovering from breast augmentation & uplift</h3><p>Recovering from breast augmentation & uplift will vary with each patient. Usually you are up and around within 24 to 48 hours after surgery. Most patients go back to work within 3 to 5 days after surgery.</p><p>You will still have swelling and tightness in the chest area for few weeks after surgery. Check out our website for our special breast augmentation pricing thru October 2010. (Vincent N. Zubowicz, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Recovery is usually fast after breast uplift</h3><p>In general, recovery after breast augmentation and uplift is quick. In my practice in Boston, the surgery is done under general anesthesia as an outpatient. Everyone has some discomfort after surgery but this is usually easily managed by oral pain medications, cool compresses and minimizing activity of the arms.</p><p>Normal daily activities can be resumed in 3 – 5 days and work in 5 – 7 days but I recommend at least 3 weeks before resuming an excercise regiment to decrease the risk of complications and discomfort from use of the chest muscle. The scars will fade over 3 to 6 months and be very well camoflouged.</p><p>Everything I’ve just said is based on implants placed beneath the muscle, which is the most common placement. If the implants are placed subglandular, so no manipulation of the chest muscle needs to be done, the recovery and return is even faster. In your consultation, your surgeon should cover all of these issues. (Jeffrey M. Darrow, MD, Portland Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The surgeon will make an incision and create a “pocket,” or space within your breast tissues, for the breast implant. The breast implant will be placed in the pocket and positioned. Then the incision will be closed, usually with sutures.</p><p>Breast uplift is an outpatient basis in an operating room, surgery center or surgical suite in a surgeon’s office. On average, the surgery lasts two hours in my office. You will be under general anesthesia.</p><p>With incision sites, the goal is always to choose the option that will result in the least obvious scar. There are three common incision sites used for breast augmentation: under the arm (transaxillary), around the nipple (periareolar), or within the breast fold (inframammary).</p><p>There are also a few different options for incision sites. First is the Periareolar, this incision is the most concealed, but is associated with a higher likelihood of inability to successfully breast feed, as compared to the other incision sites.</p><p>Second, is the inframammary incision. This is less concealed than the periareolar and associated with less difficulty than the periareolar incision site when breast-feeding. Third, is the transaxillary this incision is less concealed than the periareolar and associated with less difficulty than the periareolar incision site when breast feeding.</p><p>My recomendation is no heavy lifting or strenuous activity for 6 weeks after surgery. Usually, if you have a desk job you will find yourself ready to go back to work in only a few days. (Miguel Delgado, Jr., MD, Wichita Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Recovery after Breast Augmentation</h3><p>Recovery from surgery depends on a number of factors. Breast Augmentation surgery usually has a quick recovery, with minimal pain. Most of my patients describe the feeling as similar to when the milk comes in. One or two pain killers are generally all that are needed in the first 24 hours. I recommend you take it easy for the first two weeks after surgery, but after a week, you should be able to resume most activities (within reason). The scars are pretty fine, and most are not noticeable in about a month or so, but with any scarring, full maturity (fading) isn’t complete for 12-18 months. (Verne Weisberg, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Smooth recovery for attractive breasts after augmentation and uplift</h3><p>Our patients tell us they appreciate their personalized aftercare recommendations. For example an entertainer will have different aftercare recommendations than a teacher, etc. Having taken care of thousands of happy breast augmentation patients, we have learned what works best for you. We share that with you. (George John Alexander, MD, FACS, Boston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Recovery after breast augmentation surgery</h3><p>Recovery after breast uplift and augmentation surgery is a unique experience for everyone, but in general I find that most patients are feeling pretty good after one week. Most are off of narcotic pain medication, driving, and back to work by one week post-op, or even sooner for sub-glandular augmentation.</p><p>I recommend that mothers with young children have help with their children for the first week following surgery. Most patients are ready to resume light, low-impact cardiovascular exercise after one week, and may begin high impact exercise and upper body weight lifting as tolerated following 2-3 weeks – with proper support. The scars usually start to fade between 6-12 weeks, but complete scar fading can take a year or more. (Amy M. Sprole, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Recovery from tuba breast augmentation and uplift</h3><p>Every patient’s tuba breast uplift & augmentation recovery is a little different – it will depend on where the implant is placed (above or below the muscle), how large an implant you chose, and how much breast tissue you started with.</p><p>In general, in our practice (mostly silicone gel implants, under the muscle, inframammary incision, no general anesthetic) patients are feeling pretty good within a few days.</p><p>It would be best if you could allow yourself a whole week without obligation (such as work), to allow yourself time to rest and not overextend yourself in the early post-op period. (Matthew Concannon, MD, Columbia Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tuba recovery is variable</h3><p>Most patients need about 10 days to 2 weeks to get back to work. i have had patients get back within a week or so but this is not definitely the norm. If you have young children, i would suggest having family help out with the kids for at least a week after the operation.</p><p>Scars are generally well hidden, but will fade after about 3 months or so. this also depends on your skin type. People with pale skin tend to have very red scars, but ultimately the scars fade very nicely in the end. (Eric Chang, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tuba breast augmentation recovery not too long</h3><p>There are many factors which determine how fast a patient will recover after breast augmentation surgery. I have college students have the procedure on a Friday and go back to class on Monday. Likewise I have also seen a factory worker stay home from her job for 3 weeks. S</p><p>ome of these factors include whether the implants are placed over or under the pectoralis major muscle, how big the implants are, how tight the soft tissues are, how active the patient is, and the individuals tolerance for discomfort. That said, I can describe an “average” scenario for tuba breast augmentation recovery.</p><p>Most of my patients have submuscular augmentation, so that is what I will describe. All patients experience pain and tightness is the chest. This is worst with deep breathing, coughing, and certain arm movements. It is worst on the day of surgery and the following day, but is VERY MANAGEABLE with pain medication, muscle relaxants, and ice.</p><p>By day #3 things start to turn around and get steadily better after that. Patients with desk jobs and students usually return to work or schoolafter 7-10 days. Patients with more physically demanding jobs are back by 2-3 weeks. So the time you will most need help is the first two days. After that most people can manage pretty well on their own.</p><p>Hopefully your children can pitch in a little. Scar fading takes quite a bit longer. Most scars don’t begin to fade for 6 weeks and then do so very gradually, requiring about 6 months to reach maturity. In the end it will all seem like a very short time, and it will be well worth it! (Robert Stroup, Jr., MD, FACS, Cleveland Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tuba recovery should be fairly quick</h3><p>In my experience patients recover quite quickly after Breast Augmentation & uplift. </p><p>Some patients have more pain than others but it is no uncommon for patients to have surgery on a Thursday and go back to work the following Monday.</p><p>Yes, you will be sore and the most uncomfortable for the first 3-4 days following surgery but the pain decreases very quickly. </p><p>I would plan to have help with your children for the first 3-4 days but very soon you will be back to your normal daily activities. (Renato Saltz, MD, Salt Lake City Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Returning to regular daily activities after breast augmentation & uplift generally occurs in 3-5 days. This would not include vigorous house-cleaning or vacuuming as those repetitive motions would increase your swelling and therefore increase your pain. Helping a small child into a car seat or highchair could be done in a couple of days after surgery.</p><p>If you are a mom with young children it would be advisable to have help for the first 2-3 days. The most common description moms give of the post-op pain after breast augmentation is the pain of breast engorgement after delivery. Generally my patients take pain medication for the first 2-3 days after surgery.</p><p>If your job is not strenuous then you could return to work in 5-7 days. Talk to your Plastic Surgeon about your return to exercise. Scars tend to get thicker, red and noticeable for the first 6 to 9 weeks, and then get softer, flatter and paler over the next 6 to 9 months. Breast skin tends to heal very well so noticeable scars are unusual. Good Luck! (Douglas Leppink, MD, Grand Rapids Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Rapid Recovery Breast Augmentation</h3><p>Many advances have been made in breast augmentation surgery over the past several years.</p><p>Post operative guidelines vary greatly among surgeons, primarily based on their training and type of breast augmentation and uplift.</p><p>Most patients do extremely well with a “rapid recovery” technique. This involves early mobility following surgery, muscle stretching, and early activity with anti-inflammatory pain medication only.</p><p>Most of my patients have been able to resume normal daily activities except for aerobic exercise within 2-3 days following surgery.</p><p>Depending on the nature of your work, you should be able to return to work within 5-7 days and should be able to care for your children within two days following surgery with this recovery approach.</p><p>Look for a board-certified plastic surgeon who specializes in rapid recovery techniques if recovery time is important to you.</p><p>Scars vary depending on the location. By using an under armpit approach, scars are not noticeable and disappear fairly rapidly. (Steven L. Ringler, MD, FACS, Grand Rapids Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast augmentation recovery period</h3><p>Breast augmentation & uplift recovery period after any soft tissue surgery gets a fairly consistent answer, 4-6 weeks. The main reason is it takes about 6 weeks for the scar tissue to be strong enough to take normal forces of unrestricted activity against it. for breast surgeries I tell my patients to avoid heavy lifting (more than a gallon of milk) or repetitive arm motions during that time. Return to work obviously depends on the job if it can be done with the above restriction than I tell my patients they can go back anytime usually 3-5 days after surgery. During the first 2-3 weeks it is important not to agitate the breasts as the pocket around the implant could easily start bleeding if you were say, kicked by a rowdy 3 year old in the chest. (Chad K. Wheeler, MD, Spokane Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast augmentation recovery period: what to expect</h3><p><strong>Breast augmentation recovery period</strong> varies depending on whether the implants are placed over the muscle, or under the muscle. If over the muscle, recovery is about 1-2 days for light activities. If under the muscle, you will experience a bit more discomfort, and it will take about a week for you to feel back to normal. In either case no heavy lifting or intense exercise.</p><p>Tightness eases significantly over the first week. Most swelling should be gone by 6 weeks, at which point there should be no bruising remaining in most patients. The length of time away from work depends on the physical activity required. Inform your surgeon of your work requirements so that he or she can give you a a better idea about when you can expect to return.</p><p>Scars will fade, soften and flatten over a period of a couple months (may take up to 18 months). Ask your surgeon about scar-fading creams/gels like Kelocoate or BioCorneum. An early indication of your final size and appearance of your breasts can be seen at 3 months although they will further change slightly after that during the first year. (Larry S. Nichter, MD, MS, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Breast augmentation & uplift doesn’t have to have a long <em>breast augmentation recovery period</em>. The key to a quick recovery is the surgical technique. Less bleeding and bruising usually means less pain and recovery time. The other factor is the size of the implants based on the size of the breast. A big implant in a small breast will be more uncomfortable than a more modest sized implant. In my practice I allow patients to shower the day of the surgery and I encourage everyone to go out to dinner or go shopping that afternoon. Most patients take Vicodin the first night and maybe the second but typically by the second day are good with Ibuprofen alone.</p><p>I allow normal activity immediately after surgery but I do not allow any lifting for 1 week and no exercise or strenuous activity (vacuuming, lifting a heavy load of laundry, raking leaves, etc.) until one month out. After one month there are no restrictions. Most patients are comfortable going back to work or school two-three days after the procedure. I do not use drains or compression garments. In my practice they are not necessary. I also place implants under the muscle in everyone. Submuscular placement provides from a more gentle slope to the upper breast which gives a more natural breast look. This placement still allows for a quick recovery but more importantly gives a more natural look over the long term. (Jason E. Leedy, MD, Cleveland Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
