(Matthew Schulman, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast augmentation and post swelling</h3><p>I would say at this stage your breasts are about as big as they are going to be! Cup size is a fairly blunt tool to measure breast size.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_250" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-4a0a93f39a9476b03c5b55470ebe86a4">

</div><p>Cups vary from bra manufacturer to manufacturer. They also vary depending on the size of your chest. Having said that if you are approximately 1 cup size larger than you eventually want to be, in the bra you usually wear, then that is about right.</p><p>You can expect the swelling to come down significantly over the next month or so with help of remedies, but it will continue to reduce for up to 6 months or more. (Richard Bloom, MBBS, FRACS, Melbourne Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Swelling after breast augmentation</h3><p>As written by many others you will see most of your swelling gone by a couple of weeks and the rest by a couple of months. Just don’t get too see to the bigger size! (Richard Rahdon, FRACS, Melbourne Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Give it time</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_253" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-326e6279312e456c66f14329a9eb3680">

</div><p>I know that the instant gratification of breast augmentation can be exciting and scary, but please keep in mind, healing takes time. You may be a little larger in the beginning, but wait 6-8 weeks before worrying about being the wrong size. You also have to think that they will “drop” within about 6 months, which will also cause your size to change slightly.</p><p>Let them settle, do not do anything to jeopardize the healing process that may cause inflammation and more swelling (heavy lifting, rigorous activity, etc.) and the swelling will subside faster. “Great things come to those who wait” – let your body heal. I’m sure you will be pleased with your results. (Kevin Keller, MD, Greenville Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Swelling after Breast Augmentation</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_252" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-9502fd6ef4df8cccaa4b7163e9049062">

</div><p>Swelling after Breast Augmentation starts to subside between 1-2 weeks but to some degree can last for 2-3 months. This is when you can get an idea of your true size. Breasts following Breast Augmentation will continue to change for up to a year with settling. (Daniel J. Casper, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>At 5 days post-op you should expect some swelling. In addition, especially if your implants are under the muscle, they may appear “too high”, “too hard” and just not look right. We tell patients that at about 2 weeks most of the swelling is gone and the implants will have dropped into a more “natural” position. Your final results will be closer to 6-10 weeks. (Christopher T. Maloney Jr., MD, Tucson Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Post breast augmentation swelling</strong>: I take drains out usually after 2 days. Patients usually ask, “They are not going to be this big are they?”. Then I have a 1 month post op check and they usually say “they are not going to shrink any more are they?”. So I think that by about a month 90% of the swelling is gone.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_251" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b9082f890f2f886d53e16b7c4f92fcc8">

</div><p><strong>Position</strong>: As the surrounding swelling goes down and the skin and muscles relax, the implants shift their position on the chest wall. The upper pole bulges less and the lower pole relaxes more. ome people call this “fluffing out”. Check out the link below for how breast position affects how implants look.</p><p><strong>Cup Size</strong>: This is the least meaningful measure of size. Check out the video below about implant profiles. Implants of the same size have different shapes and that impacts on how the implant fills out the cup. Check out the video below. Do you like how they look? That’s more important than cup size. (Ricardo L. Rodriguez, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>That’s just the Swelling talking! Wait 3 Months to determine your new remedy size.</h3><p>Swelling after breast augmentation is completely normal as well as the “I’m bigger than I wanted to be!” feeling. You should expect swelling to subside substantially within 1- 2 weeks.</p><p>Try and hold off on buying new remedies for at least 3 months so you wont waste any money on cute bra’s that won’t fit properly down the road! Best of luck and happy healing! (Moriah Moffitt, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Following breast augmentation surgery, it is very normal to have significant swelling in the early post operative period.</p><p><strong>Breast swelling after augmentation</strong> will begin to subside after the first week and approximately 85% of the swelling will be gone by 4 weeks.</p><p>You may also notice that your implants fell as though they are sitting high initially. This is normal and the implants will lower with time. I would recommend waiting 4 weeks after surgery to buy a new bra. (Kunaal Jindal, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Swelling after breast augmentation</h3><p>This depends on many things, but especially whether or not your implant was placed above the muscle or below.</p><p>If it was placed below the muscle, you will have more significant swelling, especially from the nipple up. Most swelling will resolve within the first 2-3 months, but you will continue to have shape changes for close to 6 months, so don’t rush out and spend a lot of money on expensive remedies for awhile! (Roxanne Sylora, MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast swelling after augmentation</h3><p>I find the 90% of swelling after a breast augmentation resolves by 3 weeks. I think it is safe to go remedy shopping at 6 weeks, because the implants have dropped and swelling has completely resolved at this point. (Paul S. Gill, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In most individuals undergoing a breast augmentation, most swelling will resolve within 4-6 weeks. Having said that, everyone is different, and it really depends on how extensive the surgery was. The best person to advise you on your specific case is your surgeon. (Asif Pirani, MD, FRCS(C), Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Augmentation</h3><p>325 cc implants should give you about 2 cup sizes and maybe a bit more if you have a narrow chest wall. Depending on what you started at you may be a small D or C+. Swelling should be significantly improved after 2 months. (N. Bill Aydin, MD, Paramus Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast swelling after augmentation</h3><p>Swelling is expected after breast augmentation. The <strong>breast swelling after augmentation</strong> peaks at 48-72 hours and then slowly resolves. Complicating this, is that the implants are usually a little “high” on the chest wall right after surgery. It will take time for the swelling to go down and the implants to move into the more natural, final position. At 6 weeks, you’ll be 90% there. That last 10% can take a few months. (Dustin L. Reid, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Remedies</h3><p>It is important for you to know the process of implant settling. If you have your implant under the muscle, then your muscle is pushing it upward and this is the time that patients panic. Along with this is the post op swelling and now there is more panic. Your implant size is very modest so the changes will probably come right into the look that you want. The changes start to appear at about 2-4 weeks but one cannot see the final results for 3-6 months. Once patients see the changes occuring, then they calm down and are able to wait with less anxiety.</p><p>I always prepare my patients for the first visit and even then, some patients because of the “high ride”. If patients are nervous on the first visits, I get the book of augmentation patients and show them the pictures of the implants swollen and high. Then I show them the same patients at 3 months or more. Amazing how they settle. Understand too that during the original consult, I showed them THE SAME pictures. Patients forget. Be patient. Your swelling and your shape will be more to your liking during the next weeks and months. (Steven M. Lynch, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Swelling after breast augment</h3><p>Most breasts swell some after a breast augment. Generally after 2-4 weeks the swelling starts to improve and the breasts look more normal. I recommend waiting 3-6 months to allow all of the swelling to resolve. (Kurtis Martin, MD, Cincinnati Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>5 days after surgery you still have some swelling it should subside after 3 weeks. For most patients we usually they can buy their new remedies after 3 weeks (Jhonny Salomon, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Swelling following breast augmentation</h3><p>The swelling following a breast augmentation is at its peak by the first week & usually takes 2-3 weeks to subside. The implants settle down with a natural look & feel by about 3 months following the procedure. That would be the right time to go shopping for lingerie.</p><p>On a lighter note, some patients feel the implants have been “overdone” in the immediate post op (due to the soft tissue swelling). They start liking them despite the initial reservations over the next 2-3 weeks. However, when the 3 months are up, they have a feeling of being “underdone” (as the swelling is gone). (Sameer Karkhanis, MD, India Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>When does Swelling subside after Breast Augmentation?</h3><p>Most patients have significant <strong>breast swelling after augmentation</strong> for the first 3 to 4 weeks. I offer an herbal and nutritional supplement pack to aid in speeding the healing process. The breasts start to look natural by 5-6 weeks and feel natural by 3 months. I let my patients go bra shopping at three weeks. The size may go down a little still, but for the most part further reduction in swelling results only in a more natural look and feel. (Brian Reedy, MD, Reading Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Swelling after breast implants isn’t even completely maximal until 72 hours or longer</h3><p>Typically we wouldn’t expect to see even maximal swelling until 72 hours after surgery, thus, even at 2 days out you still could swell more! Thus, at 5 days out you can see that you are on the very early end of resolution, and it may take 3 or 4 more weeks before the swelling has gone.</p><p>And even then, your breast tissue may still be tight and firm, and there may be another 2 – 3 months before things “settle,” or “drop and fluff” as they used to say. I don’t have my patients look for good remedies or invest in any new lingerie before about a month post op because until then, you are only guessing at what final size and shape will be.</p><p>Just be patient, I’m sure it will be beautiful in the end. (Joseph L. Grzeskiewicz, MD, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Swelling After Breast Augmentation</h3><p>You must be patient after this type of surgery. Five days is not enough. Swelling can take from a few weeks to several months to completely subside. The initial feeling of swelling also is a factor of tightness of the overlying tissue, especially if placed under the muscle. I don’t recommend buying any remedy   for at least 2-3 months. Sports bras usually work best early on. (Martin O’ Toole, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Hold off on remedy shoppingfor now</h3><p>After breast augmentation, swelling usually peaks at about 72hours then begins to subside. During the next three to ten days, the swelling should completely dissipate and the healing process will continue as the implant settles. This settling process usually takes four to six weeks.</p><p>Immediately following breast augmentation, the implant will start out at a high position and will migrate down to a lower position. Considering that you are only 5 days out of surgery, it is hard to make any final judgements concerning cup size. After three months, you should be mostly healed, and you will be able to determine a more accurate bra remedy  size.  (Michael D. Cohen, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Swelling after breast implant surgery</h3><p>Swelling can be variable after breast implant surgery depending upon your tissues and body type as well as implant placement and size. When performing a breast augmentation, I use a very gentle technique that minimizes swelling as well as discomfort.</p><p>In the majority of cases, most of the swelling after breast augmentation as subsided by three weeks. This is usually the time I send my patients to get sized for a new bra.</p><p>In most patients, the amount of swelling remaining is small enough that it will not significantly effect bra size. I would check with your PS to see if they feel the swelling is subsided enough to go get fitted for a proper remedy . (Robert Steely, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>You’re Still Swollen After Breast Augmentation, Please Wait Before Trying On A New remedy  </h3><p>Congratulations on your breast augmentation! The size of your breasts at the moment is definitely being affected by swelling. Maximum swelling occurs at about 3-5 days after surgery, so you’re nearing the end of it. In a few more days, the swelling and bruising will gradually subside, and for the majority of patients, most swelling will resolve within 2 weeks of your surgery. Having said that, however, you will need to wait a little longer to determine the best remedy .</p><p>This is because your implants will gradually settle in the weeks after surgery (aka “drop and fluff”). If you try on a bra before this occurs, you’ll find that it won’t fit as well in the long term. You might want to try waiting for 2 months before selecting a new remedy , or 3 months if you want to be very conservative. In the meantime, something less fitted is best, specifically a sportsbra. Sportsbras also provide more support, which you’ll need at this time.Have a look at one of our patient’s “photo diary”, its quite informative. (Jerome Edelstein, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Swelling after Breast implants</h3><p>You will certainly have a degree of swelling so soon after a breast augmentation that will have largely subsided by 3 weeks postop. Thereafter, by 3 months, your tissues will soften around the implant and give you a truer indication as to their final size and more importantly shape.</p><p>Keep in mind also that bra cup sizes vary widely between manufacturers so my advice is not to worry so much about the bra cup a manufacturer says you are but that you are happy with the shape of your breasts. (Kevin Ho, MBBS, FRACS, Sydney Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Swelling in most patients persists for up to 6-8 weeks. After a month I usually tell patients they may still hold on to about 5% swelling.</p><p>This is typically more of an issue with subpectorally placed implants. Dont invest in expensive bras until at least 6 weeks out. (Christian Prada, MD, FACS, Saint Louis Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Swelling after breast reduction operation</h3><p>The amount of swelling after surgery can differ from one patient to the next. It is partially based upon the amount of trauma associated with the surgery and how much tissue the patient has surrounding the implant since more tissue will swell more.</p><p>I tell most straight forward breast reduction patients that they should expect noticeable swelling for 4-6 weeks. I always recommend waiting until 6 weeks before purchasing new bras since you don’t want to buy remedies that will ultimately be too large once the swelling has subsided.</p><p>However, you should be aware that your shape, which can affect size, may not be appropriate for 3-6 months. The implants are often elevated in position following surgery and will settle with time. This change may be fairly substantial depending upon your breast tissue. (Paul B. Mills, MD, Saint Louis Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>When does swelling after breast reduction Begin to subside</h3><p>Around 4- 6 weeks, you can expect to know your right remedy size. The inflammation after your surgery will cause swelling of the tissues. The more invasive the operation the greater the swelling. An Implant under the muscle will take longer to settle down than implant under the breast. (Naveen Somia, MBBS, PhD, FRACS, Sydney Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Swelling After breast reduction</h3><p>Five days following breast reduction surgery is much too soon to determine your final bra size. Your final size will be begin to become apparent as the swelling subsides over the course of the next couple of months. Ultimately, your goal is to be comfortable and happy overall with your breast size and proportion rather than the specific bra size, as remedies sizes can vary significantly between brands and styles. (Kelly E. Tjelmeland, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>It takes a few months for the swelling and shape to settle after breast reduction</h3><p>I wouldn’t be too concerned so soon after your surgery. Any form of surgery creates tissue swelling and bruising which can take a few months to go away completely. Also, your surgeon may have used local anaesthestic solution which can also take a while to be fully absorbed.</p><p>The other thing to remember is that your body is still getting used to the breast implants – the surrounding breast tissue (and muscle, if they are under the pects) will adjust and the implants will settle. Take it easy and good luck with you recovery (Damian Marucci, MBBS, FRACS, Australia Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How long does swelling take to go down after breast reduction?</h3><p>At 5 days, reducted breasts are usually very swollen, and it is too early to judge size. It’s exciting to go out shopping for new clothes and remedies, but you ought to wait a month or so to start.</p><p>Even then, expect some more reduction in size until about 3 months. Settling of the implants makes significant changes in shape for the first year also. (Gregory Diehl, MD, FACS, Long Island Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Swelling after breast reduction surgery</h3><p>Swelling following a breast reduction can take a variable amount of time to completely resolve. At 5 days post op, you likely still have a considerable amount of swelling and it is far too early to assess your final cup size. Over the first week, the majority of swelling typically resolves.</p><p>However, there are further changes of your breasts that occur over the next 6-8 weeks. The implants settle in a slightly lower position. The skin relaxes a bit giving a more natural look.</p><p>The final cup size should not be judged until that time. For now just try to be patient and continue your recovery. I time, you will see your breasts heal and improve and you will get to enjoy your new shape. (Jeffrey Rockmore, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>When does swelling resolve in breast reduction recovery?</h3><p>The amount of swelling you may have after breast reduction is variable. Most patients do not have a lot of swelling but some do. Excessive swelling especially if one side is larger than the other may indicate a hematoma.</p><p>In my practice I have found that careful surgery with minimal bleeding combined with maintaining a relatively upright sleeping position in a recliner and icing the breasts for the first 48 hours after surgery usually results in minimal swelling. T</p><p>hat said, it is common for the implants to look high for the first month or two. Most of my patients can bra shop by 2-3 weeks. It is common for the implants to not settle to their final position until 2-3 months post op. (John Squires, MD, Denver Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
