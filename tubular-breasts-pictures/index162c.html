</div></center><p>There is much improvement that plastic surgery can give you but this won’t be covered by insurance because it is not considered “medically necessary.” (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tubuerous breast deformity</h3><p>Yes, it does look like you have a tuberous breast deformity, but this condition is unfortunately not covered by insurance. (Steven Wallach, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You look like an ideal candidate for surgical correction. I would recommend reduction of the size of the areolas, release of the tight lower part of your breasts, together with breast implants, larger on the right. (George J. Beraka, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tuberous breast</h3><p>From your photograph it appears that you do in fact have a tuberous breast.</p><p>A tuberous breast is characterized by an enlarged nipple areolar area with a conical shaped breast as well as a very thigh inframammary crease. The condition can be surgical improved but I do not believe that it would be covered by insurance. (Jeffrey Zwiren, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Your breasts are tubular</h3><p>Your breasts are tubular, however there is no medical reason for surgical intervention and thus insurance will not cover any surgery. FInd an experience board certified surgeon to discuss your cosmetic options. (Vishnu Rumalla, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Are my breasts tubular?</h3><p>Your breast do appear to be tubular and the surgery will not be covered by insurance because it is cosmetic in nature. You should seek consultation to be informed of the surgery along with expectations and limitations. (George Lefkovits, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Your photos show a fairly typical appearance of tubur breast deformity. Others call this constricted breast and tuberous breast. There is a wide range of physical appearance for the same diagnosis. As a result, there is an equally wide range of treatment options. Surgical correction is common. Typical options include: breast implants release of the constricting fibers repositioning and/or reducing the nipple areola complex breast lift</p><p>Not all of these are needed for each patient, although a breast implant is usually the starting point. I agree with others that you seek consultation with a surgeon who has considerable experience dealing with this. Unfortunately, insurance does not cover this deformity, in most cases. (Michael S. Hopkins, MD, Albuquerque Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tuberous breast deformity</h3><p>Your photos demonstrate tubular breasts. Correction of this condition is not, unfortunately, covered by health insurance as it does not serve any “functional medical necessity” in the jargon of the HMOs.</p><p>Your condition can be improved by a breast augmentation with an accompanying release of the breast tissue. Certainly, you should see a board certified plastic surgeon to explore the available options for you. (Robert L. Kraft, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Yes, the shape of your breast anatomy would be called tuberous. When you go for a consultation make sure the surgeon has considerable experience correcting this problem. It is quite a bit more complicated than just a breast augmentation.</p><p>Nevertheless you should be able to get a very attractive and normal breast shape. Unfortunately insurance will not cover this surgery. (Ronald V. DeMars, MD, Portland Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It appears you do have Tuberous Breasts. Don’t despair!! You can achieve very nice breasts with correction of the deformity. I have several examples on my website. In my experience correction of tuberous breasts is NOT covered by health insurance. You should check with your health insurance carrier. (Todd B. Koch, MD, Buffalo Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tuberous Breast Treatment</h3><p>It does appear that you have a tuberous breast shape. This is due to constriction or tightness of the lower breast skin and breast tissue. This can be successfully treated with a breast augmentation and release of the underlying tissue . Unfortunately, this is still considered a cosmetic procedure and would most likely not be covered by any medical insurance company. Seek out a board certified plastic surgeon with extensive experience in aesthetic breast surgery for best results.</p><p>Your situation is more difficult to treat than standard breast augmentation so you want to be sure your surgeon has experience in this area. (Steven L. Ringler, MD, FACS, Grand Rapids Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I believe you do have a type of constricted or tuberous breast shape. This problem typically has tight tissue in the lower part of the breast, a short distance from the areola to the inframammary fold and usually a “puffy” nipple areola due to some breast tissue pushing into this area. In addition, in your case there is a size difference. Correction of this problem is not considered medically necessary so it is typically not covered by insurance. Correction usually involves a breast augmentation with a conservative sized implant due to the contricted nature of the lower breast, along with relaese of the tight breast tissue inferiorly. A mastopexy or breastlift is combined with the breast augmentation to address the nipple areola issues.</p><p>I would find s board certified plastic surgeon in your area who has experience with this problem. This is not a straight forward breast augmentation procedure. (Ralph R. Garramone, MD, Fort Myers Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Tubular breast condition is not rare and is readily corrected by breast augmentation and release of the constricted lower pole tissue.</p><p>As others have indicated the surgery will not be covered by insurance. You should be able to achieve a very nice result. (Ann F. Reilley, MD (retired), Baton Rouge Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Constricted tuberous breasts</h3><p>A tuberous breast has a constricted skin envelope and prominent nipple, and your breast is asymmetric with a tuberous quality. Volume is lacking and you would benefit from an implant to expand the skin envelope, and a preiareolar lift and reduction on the larger side.</p><p>Consultation is often covered by insurance, the surgery is harder to get through, though predetermination with them will sort things out. (Peter E. Johnson, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tuberous breast can be corrected with fat transfer and mastopexy</h3><p>One relatively less known approach to the correction of tubular breasts is the combined used of a periareolar mastopexy with fat transfer. Fat transfer allows for extensive reshaping of the breast, compensating for the breast width to breast base problem, as well as breast size asymmetry. Nipple areola size discrepancy and breast tissue prolapse in the areola region should be addressed with a periareolar mastopexy. (Mario Diana, MD, Plano Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tubular Breasts and Breast Augmentation</h3><p>Tubular breasts are common problem and make breast augmentation a bit more difficult as the natural shape of the breasts is very narrow and the areolas are large. There are several options to improve the shape and look of a tubular breast. In my practice I typically start with a high profile implant and a doughnut mastopexy (incision that goes around the areola).</p><p>Usually the breast fold will also have to be altered. This approach will usually allow me to really improve the overall shape and profile of the breast. Patients with tubular breasts will rarely get insurance coverage as this deformity is considered cosmetic. I would definitely visit with a board certified plastic surgeon in your area to discuss what options might be available for you. (Mahlon Kerr, MD, FACS, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There are several treatment options that would be determined after a physical examination. (Jay M. Pensler, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tubular breast deformity</h3><p>You definitely have “tubular breast” or “constricted base” breast contours. Aesthetic improvement will require the addition of implants and a peri-areolar mastopexy. It has been hard in my experience to get this covered by insurance. I have had some success in younger patients. It is definitely worth a consultation. (Daniel Greenwald, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I do believe that the photo of your breasts indicates that they are tubular in nature. I do not feel that insurance will cover your concerns, however, regardless of the fact that they are tubular in shape.</p><p>Most, if not all, insurance companies perceive this to be strictly a cosmetic concern. (Antonio Gayoso, MD, Saint Petersburg Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast aug will greatly help tuberous appearance</h3><p>Your photos do show breasts with tuberous characteristics. Much improvement is possible with surgery that involves placement of implants. since this would be to improve the cosmetic appearance, insurance would probably not reimburse for the procedure. (Bruce K. Barach, MD, Schenectady Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Yes, you would fall into the broad category of tubular breasts although you don’t have some of the other classic characteristics of a tubular breast such as a small and protuberant nipple and areola. To my knowledge, all insurance companies consider this to be a cosmetic deformity, and it is not covered by health insurance plans. (Braden C. Stridde, MD, Kirkland Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tuberous breast shape improvement</h3><p>Your breasts are definitely referred to as tuberous breast shapes. There is a narrow breast base to the shape, and the areola is enlarged, projects outward and there is a weakness to the support of the base of the breast. These features are very characteristic of a tuberous breast shape.</p><p>When corrected, however, the breast can look very normal and in your case the differences in the sizes of the breasts can be very balanced and even. The areolae will need to be reduced, made even in size, different sized breast implants will need to be used, and areolae incisions will need to be performed. Please follow thwe advice of a good Plastic Surgeon in guiding your thoughts and actions to gain the results that you desire. (Francis (Frank) William Rieger, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
