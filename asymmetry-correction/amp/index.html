These options range from augmentation of one breast with an implant or fat transfer to reduction of the contralateral breast. Depending on the cup size you wish to be, I would discuss these options with a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon who is experienced in correction of breast asymmetry. (Christopher J. Morea, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Different sized breasts</h3><p>Your breast asymmetry can be improved with different sized implants. I typically place implants on both sides so that they appearance is more uniform, but we would place a larger implant into the smaller breasts to help even you out.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2420" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-0297449e47bc5b26dc0b885dffcb9392">

</div><p>This is very routine for most PS. (Mahlon Kerr, MD, FACS, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It is rare that I measure a female with perfectly symmetrical breast. Breast asymmetry is very common.</p><p>The question is, is the asymmetry noticeable enough that a procedure to increase symmetry is required. If so, there are many options to increase symmetry including: unilateral breast reduction, breast augmentation using two different size implants, etc.</p><p>I would suggest having a board certified plastic surgeon assess you and discuss with you your options to achieving breast symmetry.

Capizzi, MD, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Correction of Breasts</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2421" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d8ace6a67b21721f2ef7d633adea7cca">

</div><p>Correction of breast asymmetry or an uneven size between each breast can be accomplished by placement of a breast implant under the smaller breast however it is very difficult to get the breast shape to match up. Many times one must also insert an implant on the opposite side, although much smaller in size in order to accomplish a satisfactory correction of the asymmetry. In addition one way have to also perform some type of breast lifting technique in order to shape the breast better and make them even. (Mel T. Ortega, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Breast asymmetry</strong> is a very common condition. In making a decision to achieve symmetry, it is important to decide which breast you like better. In patients who prefer a smaller breast, a reduction of the larger breast is indicated. When patients prefer their larger breast size, enhancement of the smaller one can achieve their desired results. This is typically accomplished by placing an implant in the smaller breast.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2422" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>However, more recent approaches include the use of taking your own body fat as living grafts and transferring them into the breast. This is called autologous fat grafting. Through this process, fat parcels are placed in the breast not unlike planting seeds in the soil.</p><p>When the grafts integrate into the healthy tissue, they have the potential to last a lifetime. When this occurs, your result is as soft and natural as a normal breast with no implant ever having to be removed.

</div><p>While every woman has some degree of asymmetry in her breasts, a full cup size difference can be frustrating. Making the breasts more even in size and shape may or may not involve a procedure to only one breast. It’s common to combine procedures for a more even look. For example, the larger breast may be reduced and lifted to better mimic the size and shape of the smaller breast.</p><p>The smaller breast may benefit from an implant also, so the two breasts meet in the middle in terms of volume and placement. If you want to go larger overall, differently sized implants are another option. A consultation in person with a plastic surgeon will go a long way toward helping you make the decision that’s right for you. (Jeremy Pyle, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Correction of breast asymmetry</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2424" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-c7b3e0b9854ed013c1592278f6f706f4">

</div><p><em>Breast asymmetry</em> is extremely common, and can come in three forms:</p><ul>
<li>Size asymmetry</li>
<li>Shape asymmetry</li>
<li>Positional asymmetry</li>
</ul><p>It is also common to have combinations of the three. In cases of volume asymmetry, this can be addressed through the use of implants in some cases. While it is possible to place a single implant in the smaller side, this rarely leads to optimal symmetry.</p><p>The breast with the implant tends to have more superior volume than the non-implanted side. Better symmetry is usually obtained by placing implants of different sizes to match the volumes. This will lead to breasts that are more equal in both size and shape. The other option is to reduce the larger size to match the smaller size. This is a reasonable option if you are happy with the volume of the smaller sized breast.</p><p>It is possible to fix asymmetry of a cup size or larger. In order to determine the best options for your breasts, I would suggest consulting with a plastic surgeon experienced in breast correction. They can discuss the options and help you decide how best to proceed (Jeffrey Rockmore, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Asymmetry Correction is a little more difficult than a straightforward breast augmentation</h3><p>When you have breasts that a cup size apart, using different size implants, or even multiples stages (having more than one surgery so that a step-wise correction is performed over several months) may be needed to give you a nice results.</p><p>Most importantly, however, you need to understand that you have two different breasts and you will always have two different breasts, and that correction can make them more similar but not identical. The goal of surgery is to make you look good when you wear clothes, and to have minimal asymmetry when naked. (Martin Jugenburg, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I like to say that the girls are sisters and not twins. No two breasts are ever the same before or after. That being said, one can use differently sized implants to help correct asymmetries.</p><p>That being said, they will never be exactly the same. But this surgery will improve things! (Christopher J. Davidson, MD, FACS, Boston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Asymmetry Correction</h3><p>This is a very common problem I see, and has a few straightforward solutions. The most important decision is to determine which breast size you prefer.</p><p>A. If you prefer your larger breast, we can place a breast implant on the smaller breast and then do a breast lift or small reduction with lift of your larger breast.</p><p>B. If you prefer your smaller breast, we can simply do a breast reduction with lift of your larger breast. I recommend an in office consultation to assess your goals and have an experienced board certified plastic surgeon examine you and discuss potential solutions. (Paul S. Gill, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Correction asymmetry</h3><p>Breast asymmetry is very common and at times only one implant is used. In general I prefer to use an implant on each side as it tends to allow for better symmetry. The larger side can have some tissue removed to equal the smaller side. (Jeffrey Zwiren, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It is definitely possible to address breast asymmetry with breast correction. In my mind the best way to address this is to add an implant to the smaller breast to increase volume and to reduce and lift the larger breast for a more balanced result. (Jeffrey W. Hall, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Differences in size between breasts.</h3><p>There are many different techniques to correct breast asymmetry. They include placing different size implants on each side, reducing one side while augmenting other, or just a reduction on one side.</p><p>My consultations with my patients with breast asymmetry take the most time since there are so many different options and sometime a couple of stages necessary to get the desired outcome. (Leila Kasrai, MD, FRCSC, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>One Breast Larger Than the Other</h3><p>This problem can be addressed depending on the size of the breasts. If one is quite large and the other is normal then the larger one can undergo a reduction to make them more symmetrical. If one is normal and the other very small then an implant can bring the smaller one up to the size of the larger one. Finally, if they are asymmetric but both small then asymmetric augmentation can be done with different size silicone implants. If saline implants are used then differential fill can be used on the table. (Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast asymmetry correction with Breast Augmentation</h3><p>It is very normal to have breast asymmetry. The goal is that most of the time this can be corrected quite easily with similar size implants. The beauty of saline implants over silicone is that one can adjust those very subtle changes in the operating room.</p><p>Also, I do not like to use different size and shape implants because long term it does not look well. Today, I will use similar same size implants and then augment the side that is smaller with autologous fat augmentation to give much improved shaping and symmetry long term. (Rod J. Rohrich, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Correction of Breast asymmetry with augmentation</h3><p>Breast asymmetry can be improved or corrected by breast augmentation. An implant can be used to increase the size of the smaller breast, however, it is more common to augment both breasts and use different size implants to improve the asymmetry. (Remus Repta, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>This is very common and there is a huge spectrum of asymmetry. There are many options that can be performed. In general if no lift is required then different sized implants are places.</p><p>If a lift is required then I prefer to do a reduction and get the breasts even and place close or even sized breast implants.</p><p>Make sure you see a board certified plastic surgeon and someone that have performed a fair amount of breast asymmetry surgery. (Farbod Esmailian, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Breast asymmetry is more common than you think. Yes, you can enlarge one side by placing an implant or reduce the larger side by performing a breast reduction. (Steven Wallach, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Asymmetry</h3><p>I have taken care of MANY patients with breast asymmetry with nice results. Sometimes, different size implants can be used, sometimes breast lifting/ reduction is performed on one or both sides (depending on the specific situation).</p><p>The best thing to do is to go see a board certified plastic surgeon and see what choices you have for correction. (Tom J. Pousti, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You can either enlarge or reduce, lift or a combination of both. In some instances the larger breast may be a candidate for liposuction if a less invasive option is desired. Get seen, and explore the possibilities. sek (Scott E. Kasden, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Your breasts can definitely be made much more symmetrical.</p><p>1) Sometimes, all a woman needs is an implant in the smaller breast.</p><p>2) More commonly, we operate on both breasts. The larger breast is lifted or slightly reduced. (George J. Beraka, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast implants for asymmetry</h3><p>Yes, breast implants are commonly placed for breast that are asymmetric. However, if you would like the bigger breast to be smaller, a reduction can be done. Depending on the cause of the asymmetry, this may be covered by insurance. If your breasts are very asymmetric from a congenital problem, lumpectomy for breast cancer, or trauma insurance may cover it. Otherwise, it will most likely be considered cosmetic. (Jeffrey E. Schreiber, MD, FACS, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>First, you should know that most women have at least some difference in shape, size, volume, etc. between their two breasts. When average patients have augmentation, we often fill one saline implant slightly more than the other. Second, adding an implant to only the smaller breast is possible, but for most women, would make the augmented breast more projecting, “perkier” or rounder appearing. Very small implants can be too narrow to match the natural base diameter of the breast. This might not give you similar appearing breasts. Next consideration would be whether you most like the larger or smaller existing breast. During an in-person consultation your surgeon would suggest how available techniques (two different implants, unilateral reduction, possible lift, etc.) could be used to improve your symmetry. There should be a solution to your distress. Schedule one or more consultation appointments with board-certified plastic surgeons. (Sutton Graham II, MD, Greenville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Almost all women, if not all, have some degree of asymmetry to their breasts with regard to both volume and shape. How much asymmetry there is will determine what type of procedure works best for you.</p><p>Breast shape also will determine the ideal procedure for each patient. Sometimes it is as easy as placing two different size implants to match the volume better.</p><p>Sometimes one breast will benefit from a lift and/or reduction to improve the symmetry.</p><p>The best way to determine the ideal procedure for you is to have a consultation with a board certified plastic surgeon and review your concerns and specific breast shape and existing asymmetry. (Bahram Ghaderi, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>When I see patients that have asymmetry in breast, especially when it involves at least 1 cup size,I ask them whether they want to have both the same size as the smaller one or both the same size as the larger one.</p><p>In the first instance , I would reduce the size of the larger one. In the second instance, I would augment the smaller one. In your situation, it sounds like that’s what you are asking. In most of these situations of asymmetry ,the patients need a little bit of a lift. You can certainly order a small implant to augment the smaller breast, but I explain to the patients that it’s probably better to go with saline versus silicone.</p><p>This is because during the procedure, I would treat the larger breast first if the lift is required. I would then treat the smaller breast with the augmentation and a lift if needed, and can adjust the size of the implant once both sides have had the breast lift. (Joseph M. Perlman, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Asymmetry in breast is a common situation. There is not one answer as to what is the best approach to fix this problem. I usually ask the women which breast she prefers and try and make the opposite breast match.</p><p>Sometimes we only need to operate on one breast (perhaps a unilateral reduction or augmentation) other times both breasts (for example a reduction or augmentation on one side and perhaps a lift on the opposite). Talk to your plastic surgeon and determine which approach will give you the size in both breasts you want and the closest symmetry. (Susan E. Downey, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Improving asymmetry in breast</h3><p>All women have some degree of breast and or chest wall difference. When there is a cup size difference there are several choices that your plastic surgeon may discuss with you depending on your unique breast and chest anatomy.</p><p>It may be possible to reduce the fuller side to come closer to matching the smaller breast. If you would like increased fullness then implants may be used.</p><p>If the fuller breast has significantly more skin envelope of if the nipple position is a lot lower then a lift or mastopexy may be considered. In general, if implants are used it is better to use them on both sides. (John E. Gross, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Similar procedure for asymmetric breasts</h3><p>In general, it is better to do similar procedures to achieve symmetry. That means, it is better to have implants on both sides or do reduction type procedures on each side, or a combination of similar procedures. If you put an implant on one side, your breasts are automatically assymetric. A careful analysis and review of all options is required. Depending on your situation, you might be looking at asymmetric reduction plus a symmetric augmentation or an asymmetric reduction depending if you want larger or smaller breasts. (Robin T.W. Yuan, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>When I am presented with a patient with asymmetry in breast I explain that you can change the larger breast to look like the other by reduction, change the smaller breast to look like the larger by breast implantation or change both to look the way you would want them to look by a combination of procedures. Exactly what you do depends on your anatomy and your desires. (John P. Stratis, MD, Harrisburg Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast asymmetry solutions</h3><p>To some extent, asymmetry in breast is the rule rather than the exception. Depending on the degree,patient’s age and the characteristics of the breasts there are 3 treatmet options:</p><ol>
<li>make the small one larger(augmentation)</li>
<li>make the large one smaller(reduction/lift)</li>
<li>Some permutation or combination of 1 and 2 (Barry H. Dolich, MD, Bronx Plastic Surgeon)</li>
