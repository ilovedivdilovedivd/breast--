</div><p>There has been debate about the safety of doing these procedures together but there have been a handful of publications recently, including my own, that has shown combining these procedures is safe and effective. (Remus Repta, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Combine surgery</h3><p>If you are planning both surgeries, and you are a good candidate for both surgeries, and it works for you financially, then I genearlly advise to do these surgeries together. Generally, together, the surgical time is about 3-4 hours. Together, there is one recovery, one anesthetic and, generally, lower cost. (Scott E. Newman, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast implants and tummy tuck are very commonly done together.</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1690" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>Breast implants and abdominoplasty are two procedures that are very commonly performed at the same time. I typically refer to these combined procedures as “Mommy Makeovers” because as we all know pregnancy can have a significant effect on the appearance of the breast and abdomen.</p><p>The benefits of doing these procedures together are that there is only one time for anesthesia and only one recovery period. I do follow the strictest of safety standards which are set by our national society, The American Society of Plastic Surgeons, which states that any surgery preformed as an outpatient, where you go home the same day, should be limited to six hours or less in order to minimize complications. A breast implants and tummy tuck should easily be done in less than six hours. (M. Keith Hanna, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast implants and Abdominoplasty</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1688" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>At The Sullivan Centre, we routinely combine breast implants surgery with an abdominoplasty. Many women choose this option because of the convenience of one recovery time. There is typically a financial benefit to combining multiple procedures. If you are in good health, these procedures can be combined safely. Consult with a board certified plastic surgeon. (Christine Sullivan, MD, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>The Mommy Makeover</h3><p>It is quite common to combine these two operations as this is typically done in healthy patients who have had children and desire a “mommy makeover”.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1691" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-abdff95d5629d62ac5fd2786e434dad3">

</div><p>It is a good combination procedure to do simultaneously as it can be done in a reasonable amount of time which is usually less than 4 hours. (Rod J. Rohrich, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Mommy Makeover Montreal experience</h3><p>Combining a breast implants with a tummy-tuck in a healthy patient can be an excellent choice. Many patients experience significant and undesirable changes to their breast and tummies after multiple pregnancies.</p><p>The Mommy Makeover combined surgery can address these changes in one operation and the nice thing about it is that each part enhances the other, i.e. the firmer, larger breasts make the tummy look flatter and the flat tummy makes the breasts appear to “project” more. I routinely perform this combination surgery in my practice in Montreal.</p><p>Mommy Makeover patients are among my happiest as many of them feel that they have regained, or even improved upon, their pre-pregnancy body shape. The recovery is not much different than for a tummy-tuck alone and the patients only have to experience the side effects and downtime of surgery once instead of twice. (Arie Benchetrit, MD, Montreal Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>A breast implants and tummy tuck are often performed together safely. In experienced hands, these two procedures often create a more attractive shape.</p><p>Of course your overall health should be assesed by a trusted plastic surgeon as part of your preopererative evaluation. (George John Alexander, MD, FACS, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Mommy Makeover: Combining Abdominoplasty and Breast implants in Houston</h3><p>The so-called ‘Mommy makeover’ is a great combination! Patients are nearly always thrilled with either procedure alone. Combine them and moms are ecstatic.</p><p>These two operations can be done together in complete safety in most individuals, provided they are in the hands of a well-trained plastic surgeon. Adding the breast implants to the tummy tuck does not lengthen the recovery period compared to having the tummy alone. Patients can therefore save several weeks of breast augmentation recovery compared to having the operations separately. (Eric Pugash, MD, Vancouver Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast implants and Tummy Tuck = Mommy Makeover</h3><p>Breast implants and Tummy Tuck surgery are frequently combined in one procedure, often referred to as the “Mommy Makeover.” The breasts and tummy are often both affected dramatically and irreversibly by pregnancy, such that surgery is the only way to “get your body back.” It is very safe and effective to combine these procedures in to one surgery, which then reduces your surgical recovery into one block of time. (Amy M. Sprole, MD, Wichita Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast implants and tummy tuck – Excellant when combined</h3><p>It is very common to combine breast implants and tummy tuck surgery at the same time. This “Mommy Makeover” is frequently done after childbirth has caused deflation of the breasts and loose skin of the abdomen. The breast implants restores volume and contour to the breasts and the tummy tuck firms up and flattens the abdomen by tightening the muscles and trimming off loose skin. A small amount of liposuction may be done around the flanks to improve the waist at the same time</p><p>This combination rejuvenates and recontours most of the figure at one surgery, decreases the cost, and is safe as long as the patients general health is good. The surgery time is extended some but not greatly and recovery takes about 1 week. This is an excellant combination of surgeries to consider for patients wishing to regain their more youthful form. (Jeffrey M. Darrow, MD, Boston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast implants with Tummy Tuck: The Mommy Makeover</h3><p>Combining Breast implants and Tummy Tuck is not only safe, but rewarding to both the patient and surgeon. In a single procedure, a woman can regain her feminine sillhouette and contour. In Houston, Texas, the Mommy Makeover is one of the most common cosmetic procedures I perform.</p><p>Many of these patients have given so much of themselves to their children, careers, and other obligations, that they find it necessary to take time for themselves. Patients frequently ask about anesthesia risk and recovery.</p><p>I always recommend that patients stay overnight to make their recovery as safe and comfortable as possible. We also recommend a detailed preoperative workup prior to any elective procedure. With appropriate workup and precautions, anesthesia for elective cosmetic surgery is extremely safe and well tolerated.</p><p>Recovery is dependent on several factors, but we typically recommend 2 weeks of limited activity and close followup. At 6 weeks, patients can discontinue use of garments and resume normal physical activity. (Paul S. Gill, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Combining a Tummy Tuck and Breast implants in Houston is safe to do.</h3><p>When combining a tummy tuck with a breast implants, the recovery will be more, but it is safe depending on your general health, physical condition and your overall body mass index, height and weight. (Genevieve MacDonald, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast augmentation and abdominoplasty</h3><p>These two operations compliment each other. Some patients will also consider adding liposuction of the flanks or love handles if indicated. The key to me is one anesthetic one recovery. That said if you are interested in both operations, I would recommend doing them at the same time.</p><p>I perform intercostal nerve blocks with my breast surgery so there is minimal discomfort in the breasts although a sense of pressure as I typically place implants under the muscle, sub pectoral. I also provide a pain pump for the abdomen to minimize discomfort in the abdominal area but, you will have a sense of pressure in the abdomen as well as I also perform tightening of the abdominal muscles.</p><p>The Valium which I provide addresses the tightness in the breasts and abdomen. These are procedures which can not only be performed together but, on an out patient basis. (Roger J. Friedman, MD, Bethesda Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Augmentation and abdominoplasty</h3><p>Having both a breast augmentation and abdominoplasty at the same time is a very common procedure and is safe to do. It actually makes it an easier recovery when you combine both, since your body can only sense pain at one area at one time. The time under anesthesia is longer, but not markedly so, and is usually an outpatient procedure. (Christopher V. Pelletiere, MD, Barrington Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>These are great operations to combine. The combination can be done as part of a mommy makeover. The advantage is that the breast implants can often be placed through the abdominal incision so that you do not have to have incisions on your breasts at all. (Siamak Agha, MD, PhD, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Enlargement and abdominoplasty in Houston: a nice combination</h3><p>As long as you are in good health and there are no contraindications, combining a breast enlargement with a abdominoplasty can provide a very nice rejuvenation to the body. No amount of exercise can replace volume loss in the breasts, or repair the fascial and muscle stretching that can result from pregnancy. Most of our patients exercise and have gotten down to their goal weight after pregnancy, but still don’t look the way they feel inside. This combination surgery can be a nice way to get that look. (Mario Loomis, MD, Middletown Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Combining breast augmentation with a abdominoplasty</h3><p>Assuming that there are no medical contraindications and that you are in good health, combiing a breast augmentation a abdominoplasty is usually not a problem. (Mark D. Epstein, MD, Stony Brook Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Depends upon the amount of surgery and overall health</h3><p>Some women need less surgery than others to get the desired correction. Women who need extended abdominoplasty surgery and/or full breast lift with implant surgery may be better served by having the operations at different times. The redo rate is lower in my experience. On the other hand, simple breast augmentation with a abdominoplasty can be do-able in many patients on one day. It is a matter of degrees and a surgeon’s philosophy. (John P. Di Saia, MD, Orange Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>A “Mommy Makeover” is a great idea</h3><p>A “Mommy Makeover” combines correction of the breasts and body after the changes caused by pregnancy. While some women choose to split the “makeover ” into 2 procedures, it is very common to have everything done in one procedure, and it makes perfectly good sense.</p><p>There is a definite saving in cost, you have only one operation, and you can heal from everything at the same time. Just remember, as a “Mommy” you are used to taking care of everybody else. Give yourself the luxury of healing allow others to take care of you for a while. (Bruce Genter, MD, Abington Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
