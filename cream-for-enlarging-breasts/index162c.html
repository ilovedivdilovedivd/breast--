Additionally, hormone therapy is controversial at best and can have many unintended side effects. The gold standard for breast enlargement is a breast augmentation, which is an extremely safe procedure.</p><p>With this procedure, you can pick the size and shape of the implant that will best fit your body proportions. I recommend you see a board certified plastic surgeon to discuss your options and concerns. All the best. (David Rapaport, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The only other real way to increase one’s breast size other than implants or gaining weight (not a great idea), is with fat transfers.</p><p>This can take a bit of effort although with the right individual, it can yield good results. I would stay away from pills or creams, at best it would be a waste of money. At worst, it could be dangerous to your health. (George Volpe, MD, Paramus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Breast augmentation would be the recommended option. You have control over size, shape, incision location, and ultimately if you want to keep the implants or remove them.</p><p>The best option for total control over your breast would be with an augmentation.

Papillion, MD, Nashville Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Augmentation – non-surgical options?</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1415" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Unfortunately there are not many (if any) good non-surgical options for breast augmentation that I know of. However, breast augmentation has become much more affordable recently, especially if you opt for a saline implants instead of silicone. The priority of course is obtaining the outcome that you want, so if you want silicone, it is of course worth it to save up for the device that will get you as close to your desired outcome as possible.</p><p>I would recommend obtaining an individualized quote for surgery from a plastic surgeon to find out what options you have available.

</div><p>This question actually made me chuckle a little. If we actually had this pharmacological method to increase breast size, Im afraid we would be out of business! The only true method to increase breast size is with an implant or fat injection. There are some suction devices that have had minimal success. (Christian Prada, MD, FACS, Saint Louis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I would recommend staying away from pills and creams that advertise increasing breast size. They will not give you the results that you are looking for and can have significant side effects. Breast Augmentation is FDA approved and you would be able to pick the size you would like to be. As always I would recommend having a consultation with a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon to determine what procedure would give you the results you are looking for. Best of Luck! (Heather Rocheford, MD, Boston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Pills or creams will not increase breast size</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1414" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-561d98baca96e107864ac4cdb3d87ffb">

</div><p>There are no proven or medically safe ways to increase your breast size with pills, injections, or creams. Hormone medications have significant side effects and will effect your entire body. Breast Augmentation with saline or silicone filled implants is a surgical procedure that has been performed for over 30 years and has few risks while providing excellent results. The current implants are markedly improved from prior models. A consultation with a board certified plastic surgeon will answer your concerns and most offices have some type of financing available. (Andrew Goldberg, MD, Fairfax Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Augmentation is Safe & Effective</h3><p>Currently, breast augmentation is the only safe and reliable way to enlarge the breast. As you mentioned, it’s impossible to know how safe those types of pills are. What we know for sure is they’re just not effective. Better to save your money and not waste it on those products. Many plastic surgeons offer payment plans that help ease the financial aspects of this surgery. You might want to investigate those options further if this is something you’d really like for yourself but you’re concerned about your budget. (Frank Lista, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Neither pills nor creams are reliable.</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1413" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a86fe13a97262f852bdd92c8b935f613">

</div><p>Hormone therapy can sometimes increase breast size as a temporary side effect, but certainly should not be used solely to enlarge your breasts. </p><p>Breast augmentation using implants is the safest, most reliable way to boost your cup size.</p><p>Many plastic surgeons today offer financing either directly through their practice or via referral to a medical financing organization like CareCredit. You can also wait a bit longer to save up and pay for your surgery yourself.</p><p>I suggest scheduling a consultation with a board certified plastic surgeon to see what your options are, both in terms of the surgery results and a practical look at total costs. (Nirav Savalia, MD, Bay Area Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Pills or creams won’t give you the results you want</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1416" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Breast Augmentation is the most reliable method of breast enhancement. Schedule a consultation with a board certified plastic surgeon in your geographical area to discuss your concerns. (Christine Sullivan, MD, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There are no pills or creams of which I am aware that are scientifically proven to increase breast size without having unwanted effects on other parts of your body.</p><p>Stick to the proven method of implant placement for safe, predictable results. (Earl E. Ferguson III, MD, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The safest to enhance the shape and size of the breast is use an FDA approved silicone or saline implant. Its safe and effective and will give reliable results. (Frank J. Ferraro, MD, Paramus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Breast Augmentation has been a trend for a little over a century and a half now and the actual procedure has been approved by the FDA and has proven to be a safe procedure.</p><p>Breast augmentation creams and medications how ever have not, simply because they have not been on the market long enough to hold a substantial amount of tests to figure out the pros and cons of these substances. My best suggestion is to hold off on purchasing and using these creams and medications. In the long run, they will definitely be more dangerous and costly than the actual procedure its self. (Jonathan Fisher, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Bigger breasts with implants</h3><p>Increasing your breast size with breast implants is really the best and most predictable approach. Most, or all, of those creams and supplements are not regulated by the FDA and therefore you do not know what you are really taking.</p><p>Breast implants are regulated by the FDA which should certainly offer you peace of mind. There is a more substantial up-front cost associated with breast augmentation surgery compared to the recurring monthly costs for creams and supplements but the pros certainly outweigh the cons such as beautiful and predictable results.</p><p>Plus the recurring monthly costs for creams and supplements may end up costing the same with continual use and you may or may not experience the results you were hoping for. There are several companies that offer financial assistance so patients can enjoy their surgery results sooner than later. We participate with Alphaeon Credit and Care Credit which both have 0% APR’s and/or budget friendly plans.</p><p>Breast Augmentation is typically a long-term, one-time expense, whereas the creams and pills are short-term and any breast size increase you experience will go away with discontinued use.</p><p>In the case additional breast surgery is needed, for reasons other than size change, the breast implant companies have warranty’s in place to help cover costs for the rare occurrences of an implant rupture or capsular contracture. (Alan N. Larsen, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Miracle Creams and Pills For Breast Enlargement?</h3><p>I certainly hope that you don’t think all of us surgeons are advocating breast augmentation with implants just because it’s what we do. The truth is that the claims by breast enhancing creams, pills, and instruments are unfounded. As of yet, there have not been any scientific studies that prove the effectiveness and safety of these “alternatives”. While herbals that have hormone-like (estrogen-like) factors could temporarily firm up your breasts (their “enhancement” is more similar to the swelling during your cycle), their long-term safety is questionable.</p><p>Unfortunately, neither pills nor creams will enhance your breasts satisfactorily. If you are looking for at least a half cup size increase in your breasts, implants are the way to go. Breast augmentation with implants is consistently one of the most common cosmetic surgeries performed each year and has a high satisfaction rate. (Gabriel Chiu, DO, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Pills cream will not work</h3><p>I am afraid this is a case of it sounds to be good to be true then it is!If pills worked to make breasts bigger or regrow hair on men then there would not be a breast implant industry or a need for wigs. Do not waste your hard earned money. Better to save and see a reputable surgeon who can help you achieve your goals (Gerard Lambe, MD, Manchester Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Neither pills or creams will enlarger your breasts. Save your money and have a tried and true breast augmentation. Sometimes the least expensive treatment has a high initial cost. A properly done breast augmentaion is immediatly effective and lasts for years. (Stephan Finical, MD, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Bigger Boobs With Pills or Creams…. Bad Idea !</h3><p>The mass marketing of pills and creams for breast enlargement is fraudulent, will not increase breast size, and may lead to adverse effects depending on what is in the pills or creams. Hormones for breast enlargement can be dangerous and produce a host of ill effects. Breasts can generally be enlarged by weight gain, but that is often not a good option for most for obvious reasons.</p><p>The Brava System can produce a conservative amount of breast enlargement without surgery, if one is willing to spend the time to wear the cumbersome apparatus for extended periods. Fat augmentation may be a conservative option for a select few. Lastly, breast augmentation using implants is an exceeding popular and safe method to enlarge breast size, understanding that implants are not life long devices and will need to be changed sometime in the future. (Sam Gershenbaum, DO, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I am not aware of any pill or cream that can safely achieve breast augmentation. Breast augmentation with silicone or saline implants by a board certfied surgeon in an accredited institution is the safest and most time tested approach to achieve enhanced breasts. (Jason Mussman, MD, Phoenix Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Pills or creams to make breasts bigger?</h3><p>The idea of taking a pill or applying a cream seems very appealing, However,there is no credible evidence to suggest that pills or creams will increase your breast size. The only proven way to increase the breast size is through breast augmentation surgery, preferably performed by a board-certified plastic surgeon (John Zavell, MD, FACS, Toledo Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Don’t waste your money</h3><p>Pills and creams don’t make your breasts larger. Find a certified experienced plastic surgeon to discuss breast augmentation options. (Terrence Murphy, MD, Englewood Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast augmentation using pills</h3><p>To be honest I would be very careful and save your money. Pills and hormones are a terrible way to enhance your breast. First there is no science that proves it works and second you are exposing yourself to lots of risks. Breast enhancement with implants are safe, effective and highly satisfactory and without a doubt my recommendation. Save the money and do it right. (Rady Rahban, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Pills and creams or breast augmentation to enhance breast size.</h3><p>HOKUS POKUS marketing junk. No pills or creams can be used safely to enhance breasts specifically. When you can afford (and most offices have financing available) the breast augmentation, then have your consultations and do the procedure. It takes under an hour and presto, you have your confidence back by a proven method of enhancement.</p><p>I was on the “Unproven Methods” committee of the American Cancer Society and you would not believe the stupid stuff that would be pushed by people trying to make money. There is a satisfactory rate of close to 99 % of patients. That beats creams and pills anytime for enlargement of breasts.  (Steven M. Lynch, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Pills or creams to make breasts larger</h3><p>There are no pills or creams that have been proven to increase breast size. As a physician, not only do I think you would be wasting your money on any pills or creams claiming to do so, but I would also be concerned about the safety of using such products. (Samir S. Rao, MD, Chevy Chase Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Pills and creams to increase breast size</h3><p>Thank you for your question,Currently, there are no safe and effective ways of increasing breast size with either pills or creams. Please be advised that there are many products on the internet that may claim to do this, but they have not been proven efficacious.</p><p>It would be wise to save your time and money and refrain from engaging in these misleading ventures. Breast augmentation surgery is the only way to increase breast size. It is a very common and safe operation in which an implant (either silicone or saline) is placed in the breast either above or below the pectoralis muscle.</p><p>Patients usually recover very well from this operation and are typically back to office desk work within 5 days. If interested, a plastic surgeon in your area can discuss all the options available and what would be the best for you based on your physical examination. (Kunaal Jindal, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How to Make Your Boobs Bigger</h3><p>The breast consists of skin – gland – and fat. The only non surgical way to increase the breast – is hormonal or weight gain. You can not absorb enough hormonal substances in a cream to significantly enlarge the breasts. The only way to make your breasts bigger – is by undergoing Breast Augmentation (Implants).</p><p>There is no non surgical – easy way – to achieve larger fuller breasts. Breast Augmentation has produced millions of happy women throughout the World. The products and the procedures are safer and more appealing than Ever!
