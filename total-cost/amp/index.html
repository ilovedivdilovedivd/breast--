(Donna Rich, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cost of breast augmentation</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1537" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The range of breast augmentation cost by plastic surgeon varies from 3000-12,000. This depends on the implant type (saline implants costs less than silicone), the location of the country, and the surgeon. In general, an average breast augmentation with silicone implants should be about 6,000 or so.</p><p>Be careful about paying significantly more or significantly less. They key is to find a board certified plastic surgeon that you trust, that is reviewed well online, and that has great before and after photos.

<li>Surgeon’s fee;</li>
<li>Hospital/Facility fee;</li>

<li>$ 3300.00 for Saline Implants</li>
<li>$ 4500.00 for Silicone Implants</li>
</ul><p>These fees are all inclusive (surgeon’s fee, hospital fee, anesthesia fee). It does not include medicines or post op garments. (L. Dwight Baker, MD, Dothan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Surgery and more</h3><p>Though subject to change, breast augmentation pricing is as follows :</p><ul>

Also included is meticulous attention to detail, consideration and discussion of your goals and desires, a process to achieve a 24 hour return to feel normal and the most beautiful results and longest lasting results possible. (Matthew H. Conrad, MD, Wichita Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cost of Breast Augmentation</h3><p>There are usually 4 items that make up the total cost of breast augmentation surgery.</p><ol>
<li>Surgeon fee – This can vary significantly. Las Vegas plastic surgeons typically have lower overhead and operating expenses and can therefore provide lower surgeon fees.</li>
<li>Facility fee – usually per hour. Here in Las Vegas, this fee is substantially lower than other more expensive parts of the country.</li>

<li>Anesthesia fee – Again, lower than more expensive regions in the country.</li>
<li>Cost of implants – ranges from $200/implant for less-expensive saline implants to $850/implant for the shaped and textured gummy bear gel implants.</li>
</ol><p>We will frequently run specials for breast augmentation with silicone implants for as low as $4450, but generally we charge from $5000-6000 for the surgery. (Bryson G. Richards, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Total cost of breast augmentation in downtown Chicago</h3><p>We are downtown Chicago, and we quote $ 6910 all inclusive for a breast augmentation with silicone gel implants, the surgeon’s fees, all the visits, the Hospital fees and anesthesia (by MD’s). (Florence Mussat, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Augmentation Pricing….</h3><p>In my practice (Woodbury, MN) Breast Augmentation with Saline Implants total cost is $5,540.00 and with Silicone Implants the cost is $6,440.00. This fee includes the surgeon fee, follow up checks, use of the OR suite, anesthesia, and recovery time after surgery. Prices do vary by surgeon and area. As always I would recommend having a consultation with a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon. (Heather Rocheford, MD, Minneapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Costs for a breast augmentation will certainly vary depending on your location.</p><p>Things to factor in for the procedure standpoint will be the facility fee, anesthesia fee, surgeon fee, other fees (e.g., liposuction, surgical garment, addition of a breast lift, type of implant used, etc.).</p><p>A range in price ~ $4000-12000 is not unreasonable. $6-8K would be a reasonable cost on average. A consultation with a plastic surgeon will help you in determining which procedure(s) would be the right one for you.</p><p>Total cost also depends on the complexity of your case and how much work would need to be done to achieve an aesthetically-pleasing result for you. (Lewis Albert Andres, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The price for breast augmentation can vary depending on the level of experience of the surgeon, the geographical area of the country and the type of implant used to augment the breast.</p><p>In my practice, breast augmentation with saline implants is $5000.00 and breast augmentation with silicone implants costs $6000.00.</p><p>The price can be slightly more if nipple areola complex elevation is also required. (Christopher J. Morea, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cost of breast augmentation?</h3><p>This depends on your area, surgeon’s expertise, procedure for augmentation (around the nipple, through the fold, in the armpit, etc.) and type of implant (saline, gel or shaped). No matter what, or whom, you choose to have surgery with, remember that a poor result will cost you so much more in the future.</p><p>Like with so many other things in life, “you get what you pay for.” But unlike a cheap purse that you can just throw away when it falls apart, a bad breast surgery will cost you thousands to fix and many sleepless nights.</p><p>That said, plan to spend between $4800-$7000 for breast implant surgery depending on the factors mentioned above. (Erez Sternberg, MD, Jacksonville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The total cost of breast augmentation can vary by region. When starting out cost is a very important aspect of the process but look at all the facts about your surgeon. Board certification and experience are also very important. (Frank J. Ferraro, MD, Paramus Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How much does breast augmentation cost?</h3><p>The cost of breast augmentation depends upon the type of implant that you desire. Saline implants are less expensive than silicone implants, but saline implants are not ideal for everyone. <strong>The total cost for a breast augmentation</strong>, including surgeon’s fee, anesthesia, O.R. charge, and implants in my practice varies from $5,900 to $7,000. When selecting a surgeon, be careful to select only a board certified plastic surgeon. Also be sure that the price you are quoted includes ALL of the charges, as some surgeons will only quote part of the total fee to attract you. (John Zavell, MD, FACS, Toledo Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast aug pricing</h3><p>Pricing can be very confusing since some surgeons quote the whole cost as a flat charge and others break it down in parts. In the end, you pay for</p><ol>
<li>The surgeon’s time in the procedure,</li>
<li>The operating room costs and cost of anesthesia,</li>
<li>Implants,</li>
<li>Blood work and clearance possibly needed,</li>
<li>Prescriptions, bras, and scar creams, etc used after.</li>
</ol><p>I have seen surgery costs as low as 2500 and as high as 8500 in my area. Some of the factors that make surgery more expensive are.</p><p>1. Silicone implants are more expensive than saline (by up to $1000). Form stable implants/gummy bear implants can be up to $1000 more expensive than silicone. Some surgeons get better pricing than others, but if your surgeon’s implants are far less expensive than everyone else’s, you have to question why.</p><p>2. Going to a hospital instead of surgery center or office. Hospitals are most expensive. Offices are generally least expensive, but be wary if it’s too cheap. Some surgeons don’t maintain proper safety standards. You are looking for a facility with active accreditation by state and national organizations. Don’t be afraid to call the accreditation association and make sure the facility is still certified.</p><p>3. Using sizers. I use silicone sizers to try implants on during surgery. Not only does this take extra time, but there is also a cost for the sizers. Surgeons who don’t do this can still get great results, but I like making sure the implants look as good as possible before selecting a final size. (Dana Goldberg, MD, Jupiter Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost of breast augmentations vary depending on the implant used, if a lift/tightening procedure is needed, etc.</p><p>For a straight breast augmentation (no lift) using a silicone gel implant the procedure can cost roughly $6,000.</p><p>This includes OR fee, surgeons fee, anesthesia fee, follow-up appointments, etc.</p><p>Every case is priced differently depending on the time required and procedure being performed. (Peter J. Capizzi, MD, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>This varies depending on your location and surgeon choice. It can range from $4K (saline) to the high end of $8K for gel implants. Surgery is not the time to “bargain-shop”.</p><p>Learn the prices in your area and then choose your surgeon based on their experience and results. It will be worth it! (Dustin L. Reid, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Average breast augmentation cost</h3><p>The average fee range is from $6000 – $9000 in Orange County for a Breast Augmentation from an experienced board certified plastic surgeon, more in Beverly Hills and NYC. Many factors determine the cost of this procedure such as who is doing the surgery – an experienced board certified plastic surgeon or a GP, ENT, Gen Surgeon, Dermatologist, or OB/Gyn physician. ”</p><p>Just because you wear a white coat – it doesn’t mean you are a plastic surgeon”Will your anesthesia be provided by a board-certified MD anesthesiologist in a fully accredited outpatient surgical facility or by a nurse anesthetist in an office facility. Are the implants saline or silicone? The number of advertisements with very low figures often involved non-plastic surgeons doing these procedures. Beware and check out their credentials and make sure they are board certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery. (Larry S. Nichter, MD, MS, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Aug Cost</h3><p>Every region is different but a general range:</p><ul>
<li>Saline $1000</li>
<li>Silicone $2000</li>
<li>Medicare approved Facility $1000</li>
<li>Anesthesiologist MD/DO $600</li>
<li>Professional Fee $2000 – $3000 (George C. Peck, Jr, MD, West Orange Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ul><h3>In the Midwest, Implants Range from $4300 to $5700</h3><p>The exact cost of breast augmentation will vary from surgeon to surgeon, from one area of the country to another. The cost also depends on the specifics of the procedure you choose. The different types of implants have very different costs.</p><p>Also, whether or not a lifting procedure is needed will influence the cost. At our private plastic surgical practice in the Midwest, the approximate cost for a silicone breast augmentation would be $5700 and a saline augmentation $4300. If a lifting procedure is needed as well, it goes up to $7200 for silicone and $6400 for saline. (Marie E. Montag, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Average cost for Breast Augmentation</h3><p>The average cost for Breast Augmentation is Mexico is about $4500 USD. We offer special packages for Medical Tourism patients that travel from other countries to Mexico.</p><p>The package includes round trip airport transfers, surgery with general anesthesia, high quality silicone implants, all post surgery checkups, compression bra, bloodwork, medication and transfers for all appointments (Alfonso Gonzalez Cepeda, MD, Mexico Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Augmentation Cost: National Averages and Our Fees</h3><p>Before you shop for surgery by price, realize that you “purchase” completely different services from different surgeons in different settings. More on that below. The American Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons most recent national statistics show that the average MD fee is $3,535, but don’t include the other costs (facility, anesthesia, etc.).</p><p>Our office as of 2013 estimates breast enlargement with implants costing $5,450. Our estimates include Dr. Graham’s surgical fee, our nationally accredited private surgical facility, MD anesthesiologist services, postop bras, and first year’s follow up care. If you select additional procedures such as breast lift / mastopexy or treatment of prior breast problems, there are additional costs. As I mentioned, “purchasing” a surgical procedure is not comparable to purchasing an automobile.</p><p>There is no engineered standard production. Each one is not the same as another. Therefore shopping breast augmentation by price won’t get you very far. It is better to think of selecting the services of a knowledgeable professional adviser. Your have to do your best to evaluate the professional, and they have to try to help you reach your goals. (Sutton Graham II, MD, Greenville Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Total cost of breast implants</h3><p>The total cost of a breast augmentation varies by area of the country and physician.</p><p>In my practice we charge $6550 for saline implants and $7500 for silicone gel implants.</p><p>These prices are all inclusive and include anesthesia, the OR, the implants, the consult and follow-up appointments, etc. (Christopher J. Davidson, MD, FACS, Boston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Augmentation Cost</h3><p>A Saline Breast Augmentation begins at around 5500 US dollars.</p><p>The cost goes up based on whether a breast lift is also necessary or silicone implants are used. These prices include the cost of the implants, surgeon fee, facility fee, anesthesia fee, postoperative bra, and postoperative care for 1 year. (Paul S. Gill, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In my area, the price runs anywhere from $5500 to $9000 for silicone implants. (Asif Pirani, MD, FRCS(C), Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>The Average Surgeon Fee for Breast Augmentation is $4,645.00</h3><p>The cost for a breast augmentation usually has four separate components. There is a cost for the surgeon, there is a cost for the use of the operating facility, there is a cost for the anesthesiologist, and there is also a cost for the implants themselves. Recent statistics published by the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery indicate that the average surgeon fee for this procedure is $4,645.</p><p>If you choose a silicone implant over a saline implant there will be an additional fee of anywhere from $1,000 to $1,500. Fees for this particular procedure vary from location to location and doctor to doctor. In general, you will find fees ranging from $3,000 to $12,000. (John J. Edney, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Augmentation Costs</h3><p>My office did a survey of Breast Augmentation prices for saline and silicone implants in Baltimore, Maryland. Total Costs = Surgeon Fee + OR + Anesthesia + Implants. They surveyed 11 different Board Certified Plastic Surgery Offices. We concluded that the Total average Breast Implant surgery costs were as follows:</p><p>Saline implants: $6000</p><p>Silicone implants: $7000 Additionally, there was no correlation between the Total surgical cost and the number of years that the surgeon has been in practice. Full details can be found in the link below. (Ricardo L. Rodriguez, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>We are having a Summertime Special for Breast Augmentation. Choose from either Saline Implants for $4499 or Gel Implants for $5999. That includes everything! No hidden charges. To learn more about this and other procedures check out our website or call the office for details. (Jonathan Berman, MD, Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>$4,000-$8,000 for a Breast Augmentation</h3><p>Depending on where you are having surgery, the cost of an augmentation with either saline or silicone implants are around $4,000-$8,000. I would suggest to not go to a surgeon because you “got a good deal” on the procedure. You may want to find out the surgeons credentials and see who also will be recovering you after surgery (a RN or caregiver). Another major component you need to find out when proceeding forward with the surgery is to also find out who will be administering the anesthesia. I have done a lot of revision surgeries on patients who have had a terrible experience with their outcomes because they went to someone where they got a good price. (Leonard Hochstein, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The total cost of breast augmentation is highly variable depending on the type of implant selected and your geographic location.
