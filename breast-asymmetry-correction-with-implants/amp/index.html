</div><p>This can be size as well as shape related. The treatment depends on several things. If its an issue of shape than usually this is corrected with Lifts and Reductions. If the shape is fine but its purely a size issue than you have several options.</p><p>You can put one implant in the side that is small but I do not usually recommend that. Once a breast has an implant in, while is may look natural, it just has a different look and fullness. You really want to enhance ideally both even if small.</p><p>Sometimes a single implant works but often you need both. Another option that is discussed more today is Fat transfer into the breast. Basically removing fat from the body via Lipo and injecting into the breast. Like an implant you can do this to one or both breasts. While this sounds AMAZING to most women, lipo and a breast augmentation!, it has its own limitations so read up.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2401" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>I am not a huge fanFinally if the breast you like is the smaller one you can always reduce the larger one to match the smaller on. Remember it is totally normal (Rady Rahban, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Asymmetry</h3><p>It is not uncommon at all to have breasts which are different sizes. There are many ways to minimize the difference and a good consultation and exam are mandatory. Differences can be due to differences in the breast size and also other issues such as more prominent ribs on on side. Treatments can include differing implant sizes, possible lifts if one is sagging relative to the other, adding fat grafts. Do remember that if one is using different size implants, the dimensions and projections of the implants may be different. In general it is not possible to make breasts perfectly equal but with a thoughtful analysis one can get good results. (George Volpe, MD, Boston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast implants to correct asymmetry</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2400" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-786f37e2dcabe0adfd2b6382831f14c7">

</div><p>It is very common amongst women to have breasts that are a different shape or size – they are more like sisters, not twins. There are certain techniques that can be performed, such as lifting, reducing and inserting different size implants that can help create as much symmetry as possible. We take extensive beast measurements so we can document the differences and allow for incisions to be as precise as possible. Most surgeons do not promise 100% symmetry since medicine is a science and not exact, but a qualified surgeon should have the skill that will allow for the best symmetry and results possible. (Alan N. Larsen, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Fixing the asymmetry in the breast can be achieved with either a lift/reduction operation or a breast augmentation. It depends on the shape of the breast, the difference in size, and the goals of the patient. It is much more common to place two different sized implants than to place only one implant. (Gary Lawton, MD, FACS, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Two Different Breasts</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2402" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>It is very common that women have uneven breasts. There are several ways to address this and improve the symmetry between your two breasts. Without a picture it is difficult to know what would be best in your situation. I typically do not recommend putting only one implant in as a breast that has an implant will never look like a breast that does not.</p><p>If symmetry is the goal I would put an implant in both breasts, just of different sizes. Some patients don’t want implant and instead choose to have a reduction and lift to create symmetry. All of these are options that you can discuss with you plastic surgeon. (Johnny Franco, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It can occur that one breast is larger than the other. Most women have some degree of asymmetry or unevenness side to side.</p><p>The use of implant sizers during surgery can effectively be used to apply implants that will make you more even. (Frank J. Ferraro, MD, Paramus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It is definitely possible to get an implant only on one side. However, this may not be enough in and of itself to ensure that both breasts look closer to the same size and shape.</p><p>Often, a combination approach is used: an implant in the smaller breast, combined with a slight reduction/lift for the larger breast. Alternatively, many women choose to get implants for both breasts, but in different sizes.</p><p>This not only helps with the size concern, but also ensures that the shape and profile of each breast is more similar compared to having an implant only on one side. (David N. Sayah, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Uneven breasts is a fairly common problem. Several procedures can be considered depending upon what you want. Do you prefer the smaller breast? If you do, then liposuction or a breast reduction can be done on the larger breast. If you prefer the larger breast, then an augmentation on the smaller breast can be done.</p><p>Often to obtain the best symmetry, surgery is needed on both breasts. There is more breast tissue, obviously, on the larger breast, but it also has more skin and usually a wider base. I recommend seeing a board certified plastic surgeon to see what would be the best option for you. (Connie Hiers, MD, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Breasts are sisters, not twins – no woman’s breasts are exactly the same – it sounds like yours might be more like cousins than sisters. There are many ways to approach breast asymmetry depending on the differences between your breasts (is it just size? is it shape? how about nipple position?).</p><p>The options include reducing the larger side, enlarging the smaller side (with your own fat or an implant), and enlarging both sides (using a bigger implant on the side of your smaller breast). Your best option can be determined by consulting with a board certified Plastic Surgeon. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast asymmetry</h3><p>Breast asymmetry correction can be accomplished by a variety of solutions depending on whether it is simply a size differential with the overall shape being relatively close or whether there is a component of shape differential as well ( one side is lower than the other as well as a different size). Yes you could just put an implant on one side but keep in mind there is a good chance you might need to change the implant in the future depending on future weight fluctuations, pregnancies, etc.</p><p>Commonly you might consider implants on both sides but different size implants to improve the volume difference. If you do have shape differences then you will want to explore lifting one or both breasts as well as adding an implant to one or both sides. Sometimes there is more than one option to consider so for breast asymmetry best to consult an experienced Plastic Surgeon. (G. Wesley Price, MD, Chevy Chase Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>One breast larger than the other</h3><p>Breast asymmetry is a common finding among women. Achieving symmetrical breasts may be not possible, but minimizing the differences is possible. To correct the full cup difference will require surgery. This may require a breast implant for the smaller breast or a reduction of the larger breast, or both. If you are comfortable with the idea of your breasts being closer to each other in shape and volume, then pursue surgery. (John Zavell, MD, FACS, Toledo Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Breast Augmentation For Breast Asymmetry</h3><p>Yes, it is common for different sized breast implants to be used to correct size asymmetry. You can also choose to have just one breast implant as well. However, please remember that breast asymmetry is very natural. Nobody has perfectly symmetrical breasts. (Jerome Edelstein, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
