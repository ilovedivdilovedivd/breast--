<p>The price for breast augmentation, or any cosmetic surgery, is determined by many factors such as the breast implant type, region of the country, type of surgical facility used, type of anesthesia, surgeon reputation/experience, etc.</p>
<p>While it is perfectly reasonable to ask for the lowest price possible, I would caution you against picking a plastic surgeon based on price for breast augmentation.</p>
<p>Often the &#8220;cosmetic surgeons&#8221; offering the lowest fees aren&#8217;t plastic surgeons certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery.</p>
<p>Rather, they may be family practicioners, emergency medicine doctors, Ob-Gyn&#8217;s, etc. who are board certified in their respective field (i.e. family practice, emergency medicine, Ob-Gyn, etc.) but not by the American Board of Plastic Surgery.</p>

<p>These &#8220;surgeons&#8221; did not spend 6-10 years in plastic surgery training, and thus cut-rate prices trying to entice unknowing patients into their offices.</p>
<p>Additionally, surgeons offering extremely low prices may be operating in surgical facilities, or their offices, that do not meet the standards set by the American Association for Accredidation of Ambulatory Surgery Centers (AAAASC).</p>
<p>In this case, they may be operating with poorly trained personnel, using old or expired equipment, and may not have even the minimum of safety equipment in the event of an emergency.</p>

<p>In short, you can feel comfortable asking a plastic surgeon certified by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons for their best price for breast augmentation, but I would stay FAR AWAY from surgeons whose prices are far below everyone else&#8217;s.you often get what you pay for. (Jaime Perez, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>There are many factors that plastic surgeons take into consideration when pricing cosmetic procedures. I think that pricing can fluctuate depending on the geographic location of the office, how long the doctor has been practicing, where the surgery is performed, how involved the procedure is, and what type of implant is to be used.</p>
<p>As far as asking for a discount, I don&#8217;t see why not. In our specific practice, we offer cash or check discounts and discounts for multiple procedures at once. Also, we offer discounts on different procedures throughout the year. We understand that people look for things within a specific budget and talking about these this helps us to better understand what our patients are looking for. (Leo Lapuerta, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p>

<p>Trying to differentiate doctors based on fees is difficult. It would not be unheard of to have one charge a higher fee because it gives the impression that they are better. Also there are those that are willing to do things more cheaply because they really need the business. Best is to find one whose results you like and even better if you can get a friend&#8217;s recommendation.</p>
<p>None of us like to discount our fees given that we think we have set them fairly, but if you have found Dr. Right and his or her fees are beyond your means then there are some options. One is to consider &#8220;filling in an available slot on short notice.&#8221; It may be better for Dr. Right to do some surgery, even at a discounted rate next Wednesday, rather than do nothing, but there is probably not a need for him or her to schedule their surgery space 3 months out with a discounted procedure. (Byron D. Poindexter, MD, Reston Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>Usually, price of breast augmentation has a little wiggle room. Most plastic surgeons would be open to some negotiation on fees, but usually there needs to be some reason to consider giving a discount.</p>
<p>Frequently, the surgeon will give a discount for military service, for patients in the medical profession or if you are having multiple procedures at the same time. I would caution you not to decide on price alone. Sometimes there is a reason that one surgeon charges less than another.</p>
<p>One may use a lesser quality or “off brand” implant or may not have an anesthesiologist to give your anesthesia or may not operate in an accredited facility.</p>
<p>These things would lower the price, but certainly would not improve the quality of your results!</p>
<p>Just be smart and research the surgeon you choose and the facility where it is to be done. Don’t worry that it would be rude to ask about consideration in the price but realize that there may be a reason for the fee being what it is. (Marie E. Montag, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>The trend is that the more experienced and established the plastic surgeon the last chance for negotiation. However, if your schedule permits flexibility so that on short notice you could have the surgery when convenient for the surgeon (e.g. if one of his patients surgery is cancelled at the last minute, or during any slow period) then you may be able to negotiate price to some extent.</p>
<p>Also Saline implants low cost less than silicone ones. Breast Augmentation prices vary greatly because the surgery itself encompasses a wide range of techniques that can be performed to different extents. It might be possible to meet your price point but be careful that this does not mean a less experience surgeon and therefore less quality surgery. My recommendation is to first find qualified surgeons that are board certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery you trust, then compare prices between them. Factors that influence the price include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Location &#8211; Will it be performed in a hospital with an overnight stay, an independent out &#8211; patient facility or a doctors office? Geographical location also has a significant influence.</li>
<li>Type of Anesthesia &#8211; IV sedation or General Anesthesia? Will a board certified anesthesiologist or a nurse anesthetist be used, or an RN?</li>
<li>Experience and training of your surgeon. The best trained (and longest) would be a surgeon board certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery</li>
<li>Length and Complexity of Surgery &#8211; how difficult will your surgery be and how long, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Will other procedures also be done like a breast lift, lipo on the sides of your breast/chest wall, etc be also performed (Larry S. Nichter, MD, MS, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>The fee for cosmetic surgical procedure varies from geographic location to geographic location and doctor to doctor. Usually, the low cost of a cosmetic surgical procedure includes a surgeon’s fee, a facility fee, and an anesthesia fee. In the case of breast augmentation it also includes a fee for the implants. Normally, you will find that the facility fee, anesthesia fee and the cost of the implants is a fixed cost and is usually not subject to negotiation.</p>
<p>Occasionally, you can find physicians who will offer a reduction in their fee for various reasons. This may be due to the fact that you have had a previous procedure performed by him or her. You will probably find that some surgeons will discount their fees for friends and family also. (John J. Edney, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Negotiating breast augmentation low costs</h3>
<p>I do not think that you are being disrespectful in asking for a discounted price, but most practices will have a policy about what discounts can be given. I happen to have a small discount for military personal for my services.</p>
<p>But for the most part, the price is the price. I would not suggest using the cost of services as your primary means of deciding upon a surgeon. The most expensive surgeon in town is not necessarily the best.</p>
<p>And the least expensive surgeon is not necessarily the one that is able to offer the most value. (William T. Stoeckel, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>These policies will vary from surgeon to surgeon. In my practice the cost for breast augmentation is pretty stable, but there are situations where I will lower the cost to help particular patients.</p>
<p>Specifically, there are rare occasions when a patient will change the date of their surgery after the anesthesia and other expenses are already paid.</p>
<p>In this situation, although it may be with short notice, there may be a concession for a patient taking the alotted time. (Scott E. Newman, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t ask, you don&#8217;t get. In other words it never hurts to ask. However, do be prepared to pay for skill and experience. (Eric Pugash, MD, Vancouver Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>Although all plastic surgeons have a usual pricing for any surgery, to a certain extent prices may be negotiable. There are fixed costs that plastic surgeons have to take into account when setting their prices such as the low cost of the implants, the cost of the operating room, anesthesia, supplies, and paying for the nursing staff.</p>
<p>However, if you have special circumstances or if you have one of more friends who want to have the surgery done at or around the same time, you may be able to negotiate a special deal. If you have had other surgery done before by the same surgeon, that may be a factor.</p>
<p>If you want more than one procedure done at the same time, such as a tummy tuck, you may be able to negotiate a special pricing for both. Breast augmentation pricing also vary with the kind of implant you might want. Saline implants are usually less expensive than silicone implants and make work just as well for you. (James Tang, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Pricing negotiation for breast augmentation</h3>
<p>I personally do not bargain as a purchaser and feel that being pressed to reduce my already reasonable prices demeans the doctor patient relationship. Breast augmentation includes fixed costs for the implant, anesthesia and facility.</p>
<p>All implants are not created equal. I use Mentor implants and do not buy gray market products. This protects the patient as these implants include a warranty. In October, I offer promotional pricing and donate a portion of my fee to the Susan G Komen foundation.</p>
<p>I am sure that others, namely non plastic surgeons who have taken weekend courses in cosmetic procedures do charge lower prices but comparing their expertise to mine is like comparing apples to oranges. (Robert L. Kraft, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>It is not disrespectful to ask for a price break. Most surgeons will offer a discount for cash, professional discount for medical personal or friends, or offer enticements.</p>
<p>You will probably have better luck if you ask if they can offer you other services in lue of a discount, such as skin care products, botox, fillers, peels, Microdermabrasion, laser treatments, etc. (David Finkle, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>there is nothing wrong with asking, but surgeons typically set their prices after they take into consideration many factors.You might find one that will negotiate<strong> breast augmentation pricing</strong> due to economic forces nowadays, but in general, this is not like somethinng that is in stock in a store, this is a future amount of work and risk and most surgeons will not negotiate the fee. (Julio Garcia, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that asking whether prices are negotiable is disrespectful. That being said, i will have patient try to nickel and dime to get the &#8220;lowest price possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>The truth is, there are surgeons out there who may not be fully trained plastic surgeons who will do this procedure for very little money. however, their results will be variable.</p>
<p>Go with someone you like and you trust. Don&#8217;t sweat a few hundred dollars in the end. You are not buying a car &#8211; where no matter which dealership you go to you will get the same exact car &#8211; you are entering in to a relationship.</p>
<p>Make your decision carefully. Price is only one of the many factors involved. (Eric Chang, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Negotiating costs of surgery</h3>
<p>Negotiating cost of surgery happens. How you go about it will determine whether you and your surgeon reach an agreement that is mutually acceptable. There are many costs that are outside the surgeon&#8217;s control: implants, facility, anesthesiology which often comprises a significant costs. In addition, if you plan to finance the cost of surgery, then the financing company (example Care Credit) requires their share of the price which can be significant. Your surgeon probably has no wiggle room with the other fees, but may working with his/her fees if you pay upfront with cash/check vs financing. (Young R. Cho, MD, PhD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>You might find as many answers as there are surgeons. I can speak only for myself. The cost of a procedure is made up of the surgeon&#8217;s fee, anesthesia fee and operating room cost and implants (breast, chin, cheek, etc.). You&#8217;ll find that most surgeons have fixed fees. Some charge higher fees (well established) patients waiting to get in, some have lower prices (new out of training, trying to get more experience, get more cases, etc,).</p>
<p>Most charge similar prices, but there are geographic differences. I give a discount when I do combined procedures (the smaller will be discounted), if a patient referred to me several patients that I&#8217;ve done surgery on, a loyal patient who returns for other surgeries or a patient who pays cash for the global fee.</p>
<p>I cannot discout anesthesia fees or operating room costs. (George Marosan, MD, Bellevue Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Breast Augmentation Pricing</h3>
<p>While different plastic surgeons may price the same procedure differently, you must remember that you are not paying for a mass-produced item that is the same product no matter where you buy it. Breast augmentation seems like a relatively simple procedure, but there are many different factors that can affect the result.</p>
<p>These include the skill of the surgeon in doing the procedure, and the skill of the surgeon in knowing what option will work best for your body type. In breast augmentation, like many other things, you often get what you pay for. Surgeons that find it necessary to offer discounts significant enough to make their fees dramatically lower than the competition are doing it for a reason.</p>
<p>This may be because they have less experience or they may be doing the procedure in the office versus a qualified surgical suite, or they may be using implants that are not FDA approved for use in the United States. (Donald Griffin, MD, Nashville Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Breast Augmentation fees</h3>
<p>The fees for breast augmentation will vary based on a number of factors including your geographical location, the type of implants, and the surgeon. The reputable surgeons in any area are all typically within the same price range and they have set fees. These surgeons are busy for a reason. Some offices may offer discounts for cash or check payments. Check with your ASPS board certified surgeon to determine their financially policy regarding these options. (Christine Sullivan, MD, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>When interviewing a surgeon and practice to have a cosmetic procedure there are certainly a lot of options out there-and you&#8217;ll find doctors who charge $10K and those who charge $1500.</p>
<p>But I caution you-the phrase &#8220;You get what you pay for&#8221; is more often than not true. This is major surgery. It is not a drive through for a burger and there are differences in training and experience that are worth a slightly higher fee. Ask about the surgeons qualifications, where the procedure is performed, what type of implants are used (you can get really cheap implants from outside the US &#8211; not FDA reviewed, no warranty, no knowledge of what they are even made of), anesthesia personel.</p>
<p>There are so many variables. I am certainly not saying the most expensive surgeon is the best &#8211; but the cheapest, probably is just that. Does it hurt to ask, probably not.but please don&#8217;t choose your surgeon based on fees. (Thomas B. Lintner, MD, FACS, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Low cost</h3>
<p>The cost of breast augmentation varies, depending on implant types (silicone vs. saline), geographical location, choice of OR facility, and surgeons. Some plastic surgeons may negotiate on the price slightly. I understand that cost of surgery is important for most patients. However, you should not look for someone cheap.</p>
<p>The important thing is that you feel comfortable and confident about your surgeon. Talk to your friends or someone who have had surgery from your plastic surgeon. Also, make sure that your plastic surgeon is board-certified by American Society of Plastic Surgeons. (Sugene Kim, MD, FACS, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Discount Breast Augmentation</h3>
<p>Breast augmentation low cost is dependent on many factors including location, surgical approach, and type of anesthesia. Procedures which already have a special or promotional price package are not usually discounted. If you are having more than one procedure most surgeons will give a discount. (Frank Agullo, MD, El Paso Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>The problem with negotiating price is why do you deserve a discount any more than the next person. Shouldn&#8217;t the person who has referred 10 other patients get a discount before you who has never referred a single oatient. What if you get a 10% discount and then you tell a friend and that firend wants a 15% discount. Where does it end? The best policy is for a physician to establish a fair and reasonable price for services and then allow patients to select physicians based on the percieved expertise.</p>
<p>That is the best fair market. You can always ask for a discount or offer a reason why you should get one and see what happens but expecting a surgeon to believe that you WILL send 10 patients in the future is generally a realistic offer. (Otto Joseph Placik, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>I always try to caution patients against &#8220;price shopping&#8221; for any surgery. You need to select a surgeon who is well trained, certified in plastic surgery, and someone who you decide you can trust after meeting with them in consultation. Then you have selected the right surgeon. As for negotiating fees, there is no real &#8220;mark-up&#8221; like when you go to buy a car. You need to have a trusting relationship with your surgeon and when you start &#8220;haggling&#8221; over fees, you may start things off on the wrong foot. (Jason Brett Lichten, MD, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Negotiating your breast augmentation price</h3>
<p>Negotiating the price is not rude or wrong but how you do it does make a difference. As in all negotiations, if both parties feel they have gained something and perhaps given something in the deal it results in a good balance. Once one party feels that they have lost in the negotiation they will not feel good about the relationship. Remember to compare apples to apples as well as the fact that some costs are fixed, ie facility, implants, anesthesia. If a surgeon has fantastic before and after photos and great web reviews you should expect to pay more than the surgeon without these things. In the end, your goal is to get the breast augmentation that you truly want and to do so in a safe and supportive manner. (Remus Repta, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p>
