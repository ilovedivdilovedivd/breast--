<div overflow></div></amp-ad><div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>When looking for top plastic surgeons for breast augmentation in Knoxville, the following resources are available:</p><p>American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive – Surgery aafprs.org American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons – plasticsurgery.org</p><p>Doctor’s portfolio of before and after photos, available on their website or in-person</p><p>Ensure that the photos are not stock photos from a brochure, but photos of real clients</p><p>Personal referral from someone you trust (Andres Bustillo, MD, FACS, Miami Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Top plastic surgeons for breast augmentation is one vital criteria</h3><p>Breast augmentation is an important decision that is best done by a board certified plastic surgeon who listens to your needs and is able to make a recommendation that will give you a natural proportional result. Seeing examples of before and after photos are helpful. (Andres Bustillo, MD, FACS, Knoxville Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Best breast augmentation surgeon</h3><p>It very important to do your research prior to choosing your plastic surgeon. You must make sure they are a board certified plastic surgeon. This can be checked at www.plasticsurgery.org. Another importanct factor is experience. You must ask how many breast augmentations does the plastic surgeon perform yearly. (William Portuese, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Find a Doctor in Knoxville who Listens</h3><p>In my opinion if you want to find a doctor that is right for you, then find one that will listen to your opinion. If you click with a doctor and his personality than that is at least a start. Always go to a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon and make sure he has lots of pictures to show you. Ask other patients of his for their opinion of him. Make sure the doctor is Board Certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery. (William Portuese, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Any breast augmentation surgeon should have hospital privileges to do the operation</h3><p>There are a lot of good board certified surgeons who do breast augmentations. Unfortunately, there are pretenders that do them. However, they would never be granted privileges to do them in a hospital. You don’t have to have a breast augmentation in a hospital but the privilege of your surgeon to do so if you choose is insurance that he or she is legitimate. (Larry Weinstein, MD, Morristown Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How to find a good cosmetic surgeon.</h3><p>This is such a common and valid question that I wrote an article for RealSelf listing 10 steps to help you find a good breast augmentation surgeon. You can find it in my profile. (Larry Weinstein, MD, Morristown Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>I don’t think that there is any one “best doctor” to choose</h3><p>I don’t think that there is any one “best doctor” to choose for most procedures. If you are choosing a plastic surgeon, I would check to see if the surgeon you are choosing is board certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery, and is affiliated with the American Society of Plastic Surgery and/or the American Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. Once you have checked this physician’s credentials, I would talk to friends who have used that surgeon and see if they were happy with their results. AS well that they were happy with their treatment by both the doctor and by his/her staff. All these things are important. My goal with my patients is to provide them with a great, natural result and to give them the best care and to ensure that their needs are attended to by both me and my staff. (Arthur M. Cambeiro, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The first step in choosing someone for your cosmetic treatment in Knoxville is to investigate credentials. </p><p>The person administering your treatment should be well versed in the latest technologies and procedures and should be able to answer your questions in a thoughtful and concise manner.</p><p>This same person should also be able to clearly outline what they can and what they cannot accomplish for you.</p><p>This is probably the most important part of the conversation because expectations set the stage in helping you decide what it is that will help you achieve your goals and how close to these goals that you can get. (Gregory A. Buford, MD, FACS, Denver Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>People in the clothing and fashion business are excellent resources for referrals. Hairstylists also are excellent resources, as they have a captive audience and they see it all. I would also trust referrals from other physicians, nurses, and former patients. Avoid fancy marketing ploys and gimmicks and don’t be afraid to ask questions. (Arthur M. Cambeiro, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)
<p>The best way to prevent botched surgery is to do your research when selecting a surgeon. You always want to work with an experienced board certified plastic surgeon. Your doctor should be board certified by American Board of Plastic Surgery. My recommendation is to also ask for several before and after pictures, and make sure the surgeon you are meeting with has experience with facelifts. Also, the goal of facelifting should be restoring the facial volume, not pulling the skin back that is old thinking. Talk to your surgeon in detail before making a decision! (Gregory A. Buford, MD, FACS, Denver Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>When choosing a medical spa, get referrals from someone whose results that you have seen and please make certain that these medical practitioners have been officially trained and have all the correct certifications and board affiliations. You must always choose the best caregivers for your face. After all, it is your well being that we are looking after. 
<p>The medical spa environment ensures that a patient will be seen by both an esthetician and a medical doctor. It is this combination of service that enables a client to get the best possible treatment. Over time, a client is able to build a long and trusting relationship with the medical spa team. Your skin should be cared for by a licensed skin care specialist who is working in a medical spa environment. This type of practitioner has had extensive training and certification and also has the wide range of services available to choose the correct treatment for your skin. (Gregory A. Wiener, MD, FACS, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Finding the BEST plastic surgeon breast augmentation in Knoxville</h3><p>Although I am sure each of our mothers is absolutely sure that we ARE “the best”, practically speaking, since we do NOT hold yearly Cosmetic Plastic Surgery Olympics – very few Plastic Surgeons with any sense of introspection or ethics can really claim this supreme title.</p><p>As a matter of fact, if your surgeon claims he/she is “the Best” you can be assured you are NOT dealing with a responsible Member of The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (www.PlasticSurgery.org) which expressly forbids its member to misrepresent themselves as such under pain of disciplinary action and expulsion) and you should run the other way as fast as you can.</p><p>These days, it is truly easy to pick YOUR best Plastic surgeon. If you have any recommendations – see those surgeons.</p><p>If you do not or want to see more, then go to www.PlasticSurgery.org, the site of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, the largest Society of real, board-certified Plastic Surgeon in the world.</p><p>All its members were scrutinized on admission and must remain board-certified as well as adhere to an Ethical code and a culture of patient safety to remain members. Pick surgeons near you, compare their training and then see them. Remember, a breast augmentation is a VERY commonly done operation. Pick the surgeon who answers all your questions, whose pictures you like and who you are most comfortable with. THAT ONE will be the BEST Breast Augmentation surgeon. (Tracy Pfeifer, MD, Knoxville Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Don’t be frightened to ask or find out about your…</h3><p>Don’t be frightened to ask or find out about your surgeon in Knoxville, and there are several important aspects about your surgeon’s credentials that you should check. Firstly, check to see that your surgeon is on the Specialist Register of the General Medical Council (GMC) at this web site – https://webcache.gmc-uk.org/ods/home.do</p><p>This means that if your surgeon is a specialist plastic surgeon, it will state “Plastic Surgery” on the web site of the GMC. For example, if you go to this website and look up the surgeon “Taimur Shoaib”, you will see that this surgeon is listed in the specialist register as a plastic surgeon.</p><p>You can check your surgeon there too. You should also look for membership of various organisations, such as BAAPS (The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons) and BAPRAS (The British Association of Plastic Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons). Many organisations such as these only allow surgeons who have had training up to the high level of skill required for a UK Consultant to join them.</p><p>You can also ask the surgeon if he’s ever worked as a substantive consultant in the NHS; many surgeons have worked as locum consultants as there is no regulation for these positions, but all substantive consultant positions are strictly regulated and controlled.</p><p>Your surgeon should also have regular experience in the procedure you’re looking to have. Many surgeons will have areas of expertise and experience, and you should try and find a surgeon who specialises in your particular problem.</p><p>Lastly, make sure you trust your surgeon. If things just don’t feel right, have a consultation with someone else. (Taimur Shoaib, MD, Glasgow Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>A person should start by asking friends and family who…</h3><p>A person should start by asking friends and family who may have had procedures done. Another great source is the family physician. Finally, an internet search for physicians in Knoxville can also be of help. The person should then develop a list of possible physicians and consult with several of them. Here is a important list that must be checked off: Did you feel comfortable with the physician? Is he board certified ( American Board of Facial Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery – www.abfprs.org , American Board of Plastic Surgery www.surgery.org )? Does he perform the procedure often? Can he provide patient referrals for you to contact them? Has he had problems with the state board of medicine? Does he have hospital privileges for the procedures he is performing? If he is performing the procedure in his office, is it certified and accredited? (Taimur Shoaib, MD, Glasgow Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How to find the best breast augmentation plastic surgeon?</h3><p>It can be hard for patients to figure this out-understandably so.</p><p>First of all, the good news is there are many excellent surgeons.</p><p>Start with recommendations from friends and doctors; call a breast surgical oncologist (treats breast cancer) and ask them what plastic surgeon they use, ask your ob/gyn, ask everybody you can think of.</p><p>After you get some names, you should look for as a baseline:</p><p>1. Board certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery;</p><p>2. preferably a member of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (this usually indicates an interest in aesthetic surgery)-they have a website where you can find surgeons in Knoxville;</p><p>3. A surgeon who did a fellowship in plastic surgery of the breast and/or devotes most of his/her time to breast surgery. Now you have several names and presumably since they are board certified, focus on breast and were recommended, they are technically skilled. Now you need find out if you “connect” with the surgeon.</p><p>Schedule consultations with at least 2. Notice how you are treated by the office staff. Ask to look at before and after photos-this will give you some sense of the doctor’s aesthetic eye and skill. Ask to speak to patients upon whom the doctor operated.</p><p>Most importantly, make sure the surgeon spends time with you, in order to understand your goals, etc. You should have a fairly in-depth discussion regarding size. If you feel rushed or that your questions are not answered, move on to another surgeon. Be sure you understand the office policies regarding revisions, as this may be necessary. Ask about complications-if they say they never have any, be wary. Listen to your instincts-sometimes it takes a few visits to find the right surgeon but it is worth it. (C. Bob Basu, MD, FACS, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Find an experienced board-certfied plastic surgeon</h3><p>You should meet with several surgeons in Knoxville. The most important factor is finding a surgeon who is experienced in breast augmentation surgery. Ask lots of questions regarding potential complications, and ask to see photos of his or her work.</p><p>The surgeon in Knoxville should be board-certified by The American Board of Plastic Surgery and preferably a member of ASAPS, and should be focused on cosmetic surgery. The surgery should be performed in an accredited surgical facility, and anesthesia should be administered by either a nurse anesthetist or anesthesiologist. Don’t feel bad about asking lots of questions! In the end, go with with who you feel comfortable with, so someone you feel that you can be honest with should you be unhappy with the outcome. (Robert B. Pollack, MD, La Jolla Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Tips on selecting the best breast augmentation</h3><p>*The most critical starting point is to select an experienced Board Certified Plastic Surgeon. *There are many plastic surgeons that are considered excellent and consistently obtain outstanding results. *Have a consultation with the surgeon in person and see how comfortable you feel and how he responds to your questions.</p><p>*Get referrals from friends and/or medical people that you know. *Look at many pictures of his before and after results and decide if you like what you see. DO YOUR RESEARCH! (Robert B. Pollack, MD, La Jolla Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Find your comfort zone when it comes to breast augmentation</h3><p>There are a couple of important aspect to finding the right breast implant surgeon. You want to find the best surgeon for YOU. Firstly, ask around and check on websites like this, to get some recommendations. You will find that some surgeons are known for large augmentations, and some for smaller ones. You need to decide what YOU are looking for, and narrow down some of the choices from there. Secondly, make sure that the surgeons that you are considering are well trained, and that they really are plastic surgeons. You can find lengthly discussions about the importance of Board Certification by the American Board of Plastic Surgery all over the web</p><p>This certification will assure you that you are seeing a plastic surgeon with the proper training and experience, rather than a non-plastic surgeon who is just trying to add cosmetic surgery to his or her practice. The third step is to go to meet several surgeons, and get a feel for each of them. A large part of finding the right doctor in any field is communication- find a surgeon that you feel comfortable with, and one that you feel understands your goals.
